1k1x4vx,nutrition,Broccoli Sprouts vs Green Cruciferous Veggie Blend,"So, put simply, when it comes to cruciferous veggies, would it be better to use something (like supplement or freeze dried mix) with just broccoli sprouts or something with a variety of non sprout cruciferous greens?

I would assume that the latter would be better automatically since it's more of a variety.

I'm curious which one would be better, one super food, or a variety of your ""average"" greens?

Maybe not even ""better"" necessarily. But like, possibly more beneficial in the long run. Or at least the differences between both options.

1k01ros,nutrition,"Does ""USDA Organic"" mean grown in the US, or can the product still be grown in China?","When buying various foods, I've noticed that the packaging often tries to hide the fact that the contents are a product of China or the PRC. They often say ""Packaged in USA"" or ""Manufactured in USA"" or ""Made in USA,"" but when you do some digging the product was actually grown in China, or the ingredients were sourced from China. Sometimes they will put it in small inconspicuous lettering: ""product of China"" or ""product of PRC.""

They try to hide it, because they know that it will hurt their sales. So they resort to deception. I've been fooled, only to find out that a large package of frozen berries (among other things) was actually from China. I never would have bought these if I had known. They were clearly trying to hide it.

I strongly believe that people have a right to know. We should stand up for the right to know where our food is grown. Some people do not want to eat food grown in China, for various legitimate reasons. They have a right not to be fooled, not to be deceived, not to be lied to about this. 

So one question is about the USDA label. A follow-up question would be about finding out where something is grown if it is unclear or unstated. It's often unstated. And it's often China.

1jzmz63,nutrition,P&G has sponsored AHA since the beginning,"Procter & Gamble (P&G) did sponsor the American Heart Association (AHA) in a significant way, and this sponsorship played a historical role in both the AHA‚Äôs growth and the promotion of vegetable oils over saturated fats.

What Happened?
1. The Donation

In 1948, Procter & Gamble donated $1.5 million (equivalent to tens of millions today) to the American Heart Association.
This donation came from radio show profits generated by P&G‚Äôs soap brand Crisco, which was the first hydrogenated vegetable oil (rich in trans fats).
2. Result

That donation transformed AHA from a small cardiology group into a national health organization.
With more visibility and funding, the AHA started to issue national guidelines on heart disease prevention ‚Äî eventually recommending reducing saturated fat (from animal sources) and replacing it with polyunsaturated fats (like those in vegetable oils).
Why It Matters
Crisco and other P&G products were based on hydrogenated oils, later found to contain trans fats, which we now know are much more harmful than saturated fat.
While P&G didn‚Äôt directly write AHA‚Äôs recommendations, their funding likely helped shape the environment in which saturated fat became the focus ‚Äî and industrial seed oils were promoted as ‚Äúheart-healthy.‚Äù
So, Did P&G Influence Dietary Guidelines?
Indirectly, yes. They helped elevate the AHA‚Äôs platform and normalize industrial vegetable oils in the American diet under the banner of heart health ‚Äî long before trans fats were recognized as dangerous.

1jyxttn,nutrition,"780,000-Year-Old Discovery Reveals That Early Humans Thrived on a Plant-Based Diet","A groundbreaking study led by Bar-Ilan University reveals   
that starch-rich plants played a central role in the diet of ancient   
hunter-gatherers.

  
A new archaeological study along the Jordan River, just south of   
northern Israel‚Äôs Hula Valley, sheds new light on the diets of early   
humans and challenges long-standing assumptions about prehistoric eating  
 habits. The research shows that ancient hunter-gatherers relied heavily  
 on plant foods, especially starchy varieties, as a key energy source.   
Contrary to the popular belief that early hominids primarily consumed   
animal protein, the findings reveal a varied plant-based diet that   
included acorns, cereals, legumes, and aquatic plants.

  
Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,  
 the multidisciplinary study centers on the discovery of   
780,000-year-old starch grains found on basalt tools at a prehistoric   
settlement near Gesher Benot Ya‚Äôakov. This site, located on the ancient   
shores of Lake Hula, has yielded extensive archaeological evidence,   
including more than 20 layers of human occupation, fossilized animal   
bones, and preserved plant remains like seeds and fruits.

He‚Äôs also suggesting IV vitamins/supplements, saying I might need 10-20 treatments. I‚Äôm honestly a bit overwhelmed by the cost‚ÄîI can only imagine how much more it‚Äôll add up if I go for all the IV treatments.

I‚Äôm torn because I appreciate the thoroughness of his assessment, and I do want to address any underlying issues my test results might be pointing to.

Just wanted to share a quick breakdown on white kidney bean extract since I‚Äôve noticed it mentioned more often lately, especially in DIY blends and new supplement launches.
üî¨ What it does:
White kidney bean extract (Phaseolus vulgaris) is best known as a natural starch blocker. It works by inhibiting alpha-amylase, an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates into sugars‚Äîso it can help reduce carb absorption when taken before high-starch meals.
üìã Things to look for when sourcing it:
Standardized content (usually Phaseolamin 1%)
Water-soluble, fine powder form for better bioavailability
Full COA & third-party testing (especially if you're formulating your own products)
Clean processing ‚Äì no carriers or unnecessary fillers
üí¨ I work in technical support for a botanical extract supplier, so I deal with this kind of thing daily‚Äîwhether it's helping brands find the right spec or advising on formulation questions.

It doesn't make sense. I'm a cheese enthusiast who regularly tries out different types of cheese. When I do a cheese tasting session, I usually try at least 50g per serving of different cheeses. I could even try more than 50g for more complex cheeses with tasting notes that are hard to identify. However, an average of 50g seems like the right amount to pick up the tasting notes, identify the texture, and analyze the flavours. Even if I was just eating cheese for pleasure and not closely studying the taste, 50g of cheese seems like a reasonable serving size.

The one time where I could possibly think that 28g is a reasonable serving size only applies to the strongest of blue cheeses such as Roquefort, Cabrales, and Gorgonzola (Piccante). Those cheeses will knock your socks off in terms of flavor and 28g would be a reasonable amount to identify all the tasting notes. The flavours of these cheeses are also extremely strong and a small 28g serving would last quite a while because you can only eat a tiny amount of cheese per bite. However, there's no way that 28g can be an appropriate serving size for mild cheeses such as Havarti, Mild Cheddar, Gouda, Emmental, Mozzarella, Brie, or Monterey Jack.",0,26,1743875059.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1js92b3/is_a_serving_size_of_cheese_really_only_1_oz_28g/

After eating, I weighed the bones which were 178g, giving me a net weight of 462g

My fitness Pal says 220 calories per 100g, which means my 6 wings come to 1016 calories without the rub and sauce which seems....too high?

1jrfaut,nutrition,Fitbit vs MyFitnessPal for logging meals and tracking macros,"I'm looking for some advice and to hear about your experiences with logging food and tracking macronutrients. I've been trying to get more serious about my nutrition lately, but finding the right tracking method has been a bit of a struggle.

I've primarily used two apps:
 * Fitbit Premium: Since I'm on a Pixel phone, the integration is pretty seamless, and I like being able to see my activity and sleep data alongside my food log. 

However, the food database feels less comprehensive than others, and the macro tracking is very basic ‚Äì it shows you the percentages, but there's no way to set specific macro targets and see how you're doing against them throughout the day. 

This is a big limitation for me.
 * MyFitnessPal: This seems to have the largest and most accurate food database out there, which is a huge plus. The macro tracking is also much more robust, allowing you to set specific goals. However, the cost of the premium version (which seems necessary for truly effective macro tracking) feels a bit steep.

So, I'm at a bit of a crossroads and looking for your insights!

My questions for you:
 * What are your favorite apps or methods for logging food and tracking macros? Are there any hidden gems I should consider?
 * If you've used both Fitbit and MFP, what were your experiences? Did you find a way to make either work well for strict macro tracking without breaking the bank?
 * Are there any good free alternatives to MFP that offer decent macro tracking and a reasonably sized food database?
 * For those on a Pixel device, have you found any clever ways to work around Fitbit's limited macro tracking? Maybe a separate app you use in conjunction?
 * Any general tips or tricks for staying consistent with food logging and macro tracking?

I'm open to any and all suggestions! Thanks in advance for your help!

Love mayonnaise but noticed the 700+ calories per 100 grams on the back sticker?

Don‚Äôt really like ketchup or barbecue sauce?

Well the Greeks have got you covered

Super versatile, goes so well with almost any dish. Minced beef, minced chicken, Chicken breast/thigh/wings, and almost every common meal prep protein.

Tastes great with salads too, goes great with most fibre/carb sources like chickpeas or even rice.

And it‚Äôs nutritionally superior to other sauces. 

It‚Äôs pretty much Yoghurt with cucumber, dill, mint, garlic paste (some add lemon if you like it)

Overall a 10/10 sauce that‚Äôs nutritionally amazing in ratio with its caloric content compared to other common sauces. ",144,31,1743571052.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1jph2hq/food_hack_tzatziki_sauce/

Protein needs increase as we age due to muscle loss, which begins in our 30s. The needs increase to 1-1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.

I'll explain.  


I don't have a lot of options in the stores when it comes to clean coconut milk without additives and they tend to run out regularly, so I have to make due with the limitid choice I have. I always try to aim for a can that separates well in to a big creamy layer of solids and water underneath when I put it in the fridge for when I want to whip it, but most really don't do that very well. So I am missing something.

I know I should aim for one with a high fat %, but when I was comparing cans yesterday I got really confused.

Most say 17 % fat, which I would think is reasonable, but at the same time when I was reading the labels one can existed only of 50% coconut extract and the rest was water and another one said it was 80% coconut extract. I compared it to the nutritional label and the first one was indeed lower calorie, but they both claim to be 17% fat.   
  
To make it more confusing, there was also a brand that was ""light"" coconut milk and it consisted of a lower fat percentage, lower calories, but had a higher coconut extract (55%)/water ratio than the full fat one. I never used light coconut milk, but I imagine it to be bland and runny.

So how can this be? I am really confused how 50% coconut extract can have the same amount of total fat % on the can vs 80% extract. The light one makes it even more confusing.

Can someone explain this to me?",2,1,1743327913.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1jn90qy/confused_about_coconut_milk_ratio_coconut/

Thus I expected that even if they are less nutritionally dense, it would be by a tiny amount due to miniscule amounts of absorbed moisture (and with the ratios between macronutrients unchanged).

But in Wikipedia the nutritional table for 100 grams of oats (non-rolled, so I assume dehusked groats) cites:
>389 kcal&#10;  
>66.3 carbohydrates (11.6 fiber)&#10;  
>6.9 fat&#10;  
>16.9 protein&#10;

>379 kcal&#10;  
>67.7 carbohydrates (10.1 fiber)&#10;  
>6.52 fat&#10;  
>13.15 protein&#10;  

The calorie content is slightly lower, but with slightly more carbs and much less protein (and also less fiber)? Also on bags that I have at home, groats list about the same macronutrients as the first table while rolled oats list *even less* protein than the second table.

I feel like i'm missing something. Does it just loose most of the fiber when it's ground into the cream of buckwheat form? I'm not seeing this disparity in oats (steel cut vs instant). 

For some reason my body doesn't like oatmeal so that's not an option but i'd love to find something similar that has more fiber.

As expected the total amount of fat is much less in wild animals. However, looking at the fats themselves I was surprised that wild animals have higher saturated fat and less PUFAs in general.

Even if you ignore the red meats, wild duck compared to the domesticated duck has much less Omega-6, PUFA, and more Saturated fat. Wild rabbit is mostly saturated and monounsaturated fat, and the only exception is fish with more PUFA's, but even those PUFA's are mainly Omega-3. All of these meats are considered ""healthy"" alternatives to red meat by many, yet the wild ""natural"" varieties of these animals have a fatty acid profile that is closer to red meat.

For example it shows the total grams of Fats at 92g but when I do the math manually it's 135.1 or 124 or 102 depending on how many times I ask it to reanalyze. lol

Also if you have a specific calculator/tracking tool that you use, please share it!

1jhqaqw,nutrition,Kale powder: recipes and tasty ideas?,"I recently bought a bunch of kale powder (Nutricost), and wanted to share what I've discovered so far, and at the same time maybe learn some new ways of using it. 

So far the main way I've been using it, and it's working surprisingly well, and allowing me to get the benefits of consuming more dark green leafy cruciferous vegetables, is to stir it into certain scrambles that I've been making. And it works well. It actually adds to the flavor. There's none of that ""gag me"" effect you often get with kale and other greens. 

The scramble I've been basing this on is ""Joe's Special"" from Original Joe's (recipes available online). Below is my variation on Joe's Special. This ""Joe's Special"" scramble is wide open to variations and experimentation.

The primary ingredients I've been using in the scrambles are whole grains ‚Äî millet, rice, quinoa, others ‚Äî plus pea protein powder, plus a bunch of great spices (Szechuan seasoning freshly ground, dried minced onion and garlic, fresh ginger, fresh garlic, a bit of sweetener, balsamic vinegar, sweet basil, sometimes Italian herbs, black pepper, turmeric, nutmeg or mace (these add a very nice touch ‚Äî I learned to use them through researching Original Joe's recipes), dried mushrooms, a little peanut butter, a little toasted sesame oil or olive oil).

I pressure cook it all, and at the end stir and fluff, then add a good-sized scoop (~one heaping tablespoon) of the kale powder and stir it in. 

It's great. 

If anybody else has any ideas please post. I believe in dark green leafy vegetables (especially dark green leafy cruciferous vegetables), and this is one way of getting more of them into one's diet. 

I haven't tried adding the kale powder to smoothies yet, but I'm going to try that and see if I can make actually be tasty and enjoyable.",1,3,1742700652.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1jhqaqw/kale_powder_recipes_and_tasty_ideas/

1jhhh5r,nutrition,Protein: building blocks and fuel source,"Protein has become one of if not the most prevalent topics in health, sport, and nutrition in recent years. This sub sees multiple protein-based questions every week, the number of protein-fortified food products has soared, influencers are drinking chicken smoothies, etc.

One topic that I am surprised rarely comes up (and yes, I searched the sub history and found pretty much nothing) is the exclusivity of protein utilization as a building block vs as a fuel source. 

Everywhere you look you will see calories attributed to protein. This makes sense because proteins can be used to generate energy. It's 4ish calories per gram (although utilization is inefficient per TEF and the real output may only be 3ish calories per gram). This is why the calories for e.g. a 82g chicken breast is listed as 128, 104 of which come from 26g of protein. 

The problem with this common understanding is that our bodies need to use an amount newly-digested amino acids every day to replace degraded ones or to grow. We can recycle some, but not everything. And an amino acid cannot simultaneously be used to build a protein AND be deaminated for energy. It's either one or the other. 

Of course, the body's choice to use an amino acid for one purpose or another is quite complicated. The common way to talk about it is to say that the body prefers carbs and fats for energy and won't turn to protein for calories unless it runs out of the other two. However, if you consume more protein than necessary the excess will be used for energy (yes, that energy will be stored as fat in excess), and there is probably some protein metabolism happening at all times. 

But we know there must be some amount of protein that does not enter our energy system at all because it gets used as building blocks for other stuff. The entire reason protein is tending today is because of all the non-caloric benefits of protein - we're not drinking protein shakes because we need the calories. 

Let's say a typical person has a TDEE of 2000 kcal and also needs 50g of protein for basic maintenance. If such a person were to eat 2200 calories per nutrition labels, including 100g protein, it would appear that person consumed an excess of 200 calories. Do that every day and the math suggests that person will gain 20ish pounds of fat in a year - that's a lot! But if 50g of protein is being used as building blocks to repair muscle, build hormones, etc, then that person is not consuming excess calories at all. They will not gain any weight. 

Given the obsession with calorie counting, protein macro counting, etc, it puzzles me that we don't have common estimates for protein utilization. There are endless debates about how much protein we should eat, but no one is saying ""the first Xg of protein provide zero calories."" 

I can imagine a few possible reasons for this:

1 - This level of analysis doesn't boil down to easy advice (like eat Xg protein per day), so no one bothers.

2 - Somehow our bodies really can have their cake and eat it too when it comes to amino acids. 

3 - Utilization is actually quite a small percentage of protein consumed, such that it is negligible. Maybe we're only using 5g per day, and if we want to induce our bodies to use an extra gram we have to eat 20-30 grams. 

4 - no one has thought of it before (probably not).

I know adding banana to a berry smoothie can reduce the amount of flavanols you consume by up to 84%. and that Flavanols are compounds that support heart and cognitive health

Anyways I‚Äôm curious. I usually make a fruit smoothie in the morning that contains bananas, blueberries, strawberry‚Äôs, kale, and pineapple pieces with about 3 servings of Fage Greek yogurt. 

Is there certain fruits I should only mix together so that I get max nutrition from it? And if so, are any of the fruits I listed above getting In the way of protein absorption or other health benefit absorptions like I said up above about the flavanols? I‚Äôm new to nutrition and I‚Äôm just curious if there‚Äôs anything I should know. Or if it‚Äôs all fine making the smoothies the way I am making them.

I have a tendency to want to go low to see results, like between 1300-1600, with every early 2000‚Äôs women‚Äôs magazine cover burned into my brain about eating low calorie. As I‚Äôm getting older, it works for water weight/maybe a few pounds of fat, and then it just doesn‚Äôt beyond that. I‚Äôm knowledgeable enough to know this isn‚Äôt the best method, but the desperation to lose fat takes over. I also know this is because of the obvious reasons of restriction, which leads to me not following that deficit because I‚Äôm hungry or craving foods. It‚Äôs just an evil cycle!

My RMR test today put my baseline at 1,860 calories. Mentally, this is hard to wrap my head around that this is my minimum with no activity. My weight is a bit higher, but I also exercise and lift regularly, have an active job that keeps my NEAT higher, and I have 100 lbs of muscle mass.

Also, any recommendations on how many calories I should aim for? I was thinking maybe start at 1,900, see what happens and how I‚Äôm feeling, and adjust from there.

1k2dhwv,loseit,How to find a healthy way of eating (i.e. much less sugar),"Hello lovely people and fellow weight losers! 

I'm 5'5 and weigh 134 lbs. I have started my weight loss journey at 145 roughly two months ago and I would like to reach ~123 again. I'm mainly sitting at my desk all day but I have a dog and we usually walk or hike for one to two hours per day. If the calculator I used works correctly my BMR should be at about 1300 calories per day and my TDEE roughly at 1500-1600. 

So. I'm trying to change my eating habits. I'm a stress eater and I'm not doing good atm. :'( I have read a little into sugar addiction (spoiler: I am addicted to sugar) but there's absolutely no way I can go cold turkey atm. I really need to function right now and I'm not in a good headspace, like, at all.

I am actually using another program than counting calories but it has a calorie tracker, too, and I mainly focus on that as I believe in CICO. But I also know, of course, that the quality of the food I eat and the micro nutrients are important for a healthy body.

While I have lost half of what I intend, I'm currently stuck. And I'm so freaking hungry at times, e.g. today. I haven't eaten enough at all yesterday, I didn't even reach my BMR, but I just wasn't hungry. Then today, I ate way more than I should and I feel terrible about it.

I already noticed I got a healthier relation to portion sizes (as in: I actually realise now when I'm actually full). I also like my body shape a lot more already. But I really need to cut at least part of my daily sugar intake. How did you manage to do this if you have had the same problem? I'm so frustrated with myself.

1k2d5e7,loseit,New to the group,"Hey everyone, I just started to lose weight a few weeks ago. Started at 151 lbs, currently at 146.2 lbs. I've decided to walk 30 minutes briskly 7 days a week, listening to podcasts since it's more interesting than straight music, and so far so good. I use the Fitbit app to measure calories too. My goal is to get to 104 lb before Halloween.

I've found that going out and getting exercise done early in the morning first thing is helpful, because when I'm done I can take a shower and relax. If it's too cold or too hot though I'll be inside. For now it's really nice enjoying the Spring weather and being present in the moment. 

This might sound kind of silly, but every day I put a heart sticker on my calendar to mark that I did something healthy for my body.

Healthy habits I've been working on besides walking 30 minutes a day are drinking enough water, resting when I need to, and being mindful. I Started telling myself ""I get to eat Breakfast"" ""I get to eat lunch"" ""I get to eat dinner"" because in reality having food and getting a choice is an amazing privilege I used to take for granted.

1k2d487,loseit,I've decided to eat less,"30 year old male here, morbidly obese by the BMI scale. Always have had a large appetite since childhood and while I've managed to bring down my weight down multiple times it's never stuck. It seems to always be going really well until one day it isn't and my old eating patterns kick back in full force and I go back to my old weight fairly quickly. I think I will always have a slightly difficult relationship with food and I think my appetite might always be a little bit out of sync with how much food I really need to eat, however I really want to lose weight this time for good and figure out a way I can respond to periods where I've eaten a little more or been a little unhealthy. 

What I'm going to try is intuitive eating. I'm going to eat when I'm hungry, stop when I'm full, eat slowly, and if I'm still hungry after eating, give it a little bit of time and if I'm still feeling overly hungry eat some more. 

I'm going to allow myself to be a teeny tiny bit hungry some of the time but never allow myself to be remain ravenous in the name of weight loss. At the same time, I am going to try and eat ever so slightly less and if I am a tiny bit hungry a small amount of the time that is ok. I am not going to starve myself, but at the same time, I'm not going to obsess over completely eliminating the sensation of hunger from my life. If I'm a tiny bit hungry, that's ok! It is not the end of the world. 

Things I will be doing

* Eating when I'm hungry
* Stopping when I'm full
* Smaller portion sizes
* Going back for seconds if I'm still hungry
* Excercising
* Eating healthy
* Eating slower
* Having treats
* Enjoying food
* Finding foods that satisfy me/make me feel good/make me happy

Thing I will NOT be doing

* Elimitating food groups
* Elimitating treats
* Starving myself
* Weighing myself
* Calorie counting
* Obsessing over weight loss
* Life hacks to avoid feelings of hunger
* Obsessing over weight loss

If this doesn't work and I don't see clear progress I might have to go back to the drawing board. I know this will be difficult and the weight isn't just going to slide off. I don't want that. I don't want the weight to come off in a way that isn't sustainable. I want to slowly and steadily bring down how many callories I'm eating. I want to have a sustainable healthy relationship with food. ",10,10,1745003780.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k2d487/ive_decided_to_eat_less/

1k2bz8u,loseit,it's so much easier when it's just about food,"I've had issues with my weight my whole life and a pretty horrible eating disorder as a teen.  I've been messed up since I was a kid and a bunch of factors meant that food became so much more than food to me, my body was everything wrong with the world and I hated life.  My heaviest was when I was around 25.  At that point it wasn't an eating disorder, really, but I would call it a food addiction.  I just gave up, basically.   

Of course, I tried a lot of things to at least keep my mobility.  I walked so much people didn't believe me.  They either thought nobody my weight could keep that up or there was no way I could sustain my weight if I really did walk that much.  I started jogging when I was around 280 lbs and nobody believed that either.  I'm still very overweight and jogged five miles recently, which took me just over an hour.  What I'm saying is not 'healthy at every size' but that there are things you can do for yourself that really won't impact your weight.  You can try so hard and it just doesn't do anything.

**Sometimes you need therapy.**  Sometimes it's about love.  Sometimes when food is more than food, diet and exercise aren't the way you're going to get out of that.  At least not on their own.  A couple of years ago, I did manage to lose about 40lbs counting calories but I feel like 'at what cost?'  It was SO disordered and brought me back to the living hell of my teenage years.  I obsessed and really felt like I was damaging myself, but it was and still is the only way I've ever been able to lose weight.  I've kept it off and it's slowly creeping back so I'm trying calorie counting again.

Holy shit.  it's *so much easier* when it's just food.  It's not about control, it's not about filling a gap, it's not about numbing pain, it's not about self-worth, it's just about eating less.  Ya, it still sucks that I'm hungry and can't eat things I really want to, but that's nothing *nothing* compared to the mind fuck restriction was only three years ago. 

The difference now is that I have a life.  I have work, I have friends, I have some support.  The isolation was the issue, the low self-esteem was the issue, the damage I tried so hard to fix by myself was the issue.  Community and connection was the solution.

1k2brbj,loseit,"CICO is simple, but it's not easy","If you burn more than you eat, on average over a long period of time, you will lose weight. Simple. 

------

This is complicated by a few factors: being accurate, being consistent, and being sustainable, experiencing changes in health, and accounting for difficult emotions. The body and the mind have to both cooperate.

Accuracy requires you to weigh and log everything, and to calculate your TDEE and activity calories accurately (adjusting as you lose weight). It's a matter of better data and educating yourself. 

Consistency means sticking to a deficit on average over days, weeks, months (excepting the occasional deliberate diet break). Don't sabotage your progress every few days, and be honest with yourself when you do. It's a matter of discipline, accountability, and building systems for success. 

Sustainability means you re eating in a way that makes you feel in control. You aren't over-restricting and binging, you aren't treating this like a crash diet. Its a matter of balance and understanding your body.

Medications and health conditions are important to account for. Go easy on yourself if you're going through health issues/changes. 

Mindset is also complicated by stress, trauma, mood disorders, etc. Whatever your health journey looks like, mental health comes first. Do what is right for you. 

-----

So, in the end, the reason commenters go back to ""cico"" when someone posts that they can't lose weight, is that cico is simple. But it's not easy. If it were easy we would all be whatever size we wanted to be. 

The hardest part is the mental journey. Always be learning, always be open, always get back up after failure, always love yourself first.

I‚Äôm embarrassed to admit this, but I was actually (voluntarily) bedbound and slept every moment I wasn‚Äôt drinking. I gained over 100lbs. 

It‚Äôs been about a year since then and I‚Äôve slowly been able to work on my mental health. Now I‚Äôm at the point where I can (and want) to work on my physical health. I am female, 5‚Äô4, 245lbs. Here are my questions:

1. I‚Äôve started going on walks for about 20 minutes 3-4 times a week. It is uncomfortable because I, obviously, haven‚Äôt moved my body enough in a long time. Even though it‚Äôs *just* walking, is that still enough to help with weight loss? Or are the effects of walking so minimal that it doesn‚Äôt make a huge difference in weight loss? Should I be doing something different?

2. I used to binge eat and binge drink during that time. I now limit myself to 1,500 calories a day and do my best to accurately track my intake. I expected that such a sudden increase in exercise and decrease in calories would make me drop water weight quickly. However, I haven‚Äôt. Am I doing the right thing? 

3. Anyone have any advice for someone in my position? I know consistency is key so I‚Äôm doing my absolute best to not binge (nights are hardest). 

Thank you for being such a supportive community that people like me can turn to!",3,9,1744996337.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k2a672/am_i_doing_enough_or_not_enough/
1k2a1tf,loseit,100lbs down along with an NSV this week!,"So yeah, I (44M, 5'10"") started my weight loss journey back in October when I was 369lbs and feeling miserable. I had recently hurt my ""good"" knee when I was hammered while playing disc golf and went to see the doctor to get it sorted out. She told me the same thing she's been telling me for years ""you need to consider losing weight. You need to consider drinking less. You're at risk for heart disease, stroke, and diabetes if you don't improve your health,"" yada yada, blah blah. I was ""only"" drinking two handles of Jameson per week along with 30-40 beers and 3-5 bottles of wine. I had things totally under control...



As it turns out, my knee problem was basically crippling me and dramatically impacting my life in general, to the point where even getting onto and off of the toilet was excruciatingly painful. I went to physical therapy, and after weeks of doing all the stuff the therapist said, I realized that the main thing holding me back from getting better was my weight.



I went back to my PCP and asked her what options I had for losing weight outside of GLP1's, and she referred me to a medical weight management program offered through the hospital network. With everything as shitty as it was in my life, I decided this was probably my best option.



I went through the blood testing and initial visits with the program doctor and was accepted into the MWM program to start at the beginning of December. So basically, since December 13th of last year, I have been in the program, eating between 900-1100 calories per day and losing about 5lbs per week. The program is a complete meal replacement program where you can only eat the food provided by the program (shakes, bars, and soups with a 40/20/40 macro breakdown of protein/fat/carbs and 160 calories per item), biweekly check-ins with medical staff, monthly bloodwork and meetings with the program doctor, and weekly group sessions with my cohort of 20 other folks in similar situations to me.



Since December, I have also increased my steps from an average of <2k to an average of over 10k per day. And by ""walking,"" I mean not just walking around in general but walking briskly with an elevated heart rate for at least 10k steps. Three weeks ago, we were able to start transitioning back to ""real"" food and add some calories back in, too. So I have been enjoying lots of tuna, salmon, avocados, veggies, 93/7 ground beef, and shrimp meals along with my meal replacements. Since I was eating more calories, I started going to the gym with a personal trainer for 3 1-hour weight training sessions per week.



With all of this, I am currently 126 days sober and have gone from 369lbs to 266lbs, and I feel absolutely AMAZING! My cholesterol has dropped from over 250 down to 155, A1C dropped from 5.6 to 4.8, blood pressure has dropped from crazy high (like 140/95) down to ~115/70 AND they have taken me off two of the three BP meds I was on, and reduced the last one by half. Really amazing improvement according to my Dr.



What about the NSV? Last week, the company I work for had a ""global wellness challenge"" where you could join a team and track your steps and activities in a friendly competition with your coworkers. I set up a team with nine other folks from my org, and over the week, we walked 1,163,139 steps, with me contributing 174,026 (87 miles!) myself. Our team got 10th place out of 231 teams, and I came in 40th out of 1037 participants. While neither of these numbers is #1, we (and I) did far better than I ever could have imagined. Especially if you had told me I would walk 87 miles in a week back in October, I would have told you to frig off with your crazy nonsense, lol.



Anyway, that's my story! I'm still planning on continuing the program at least until August, and I hope to be down another 90 lbs or so by this time next year.",15,8,1744996038.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k2a1tf/100lbs_down_along_with_an_nsv_this_week/

1k296nb,loseit,My apology - Counting calories DOES work and I was WRONG - DON'T GIVE UP,"I made a post about a month ago. I was complaining about not losing weight and this was very early on in my counting calories / weight loss journey. 


I wanted to make this post for anyone having self doubt... And also give an update.

The truth is I've lost weight in the past from ways that are not very ideal.. and I was used to fast results, so that kinda spoiled me. I began really thinking counting calories doesn't work and something was wrong with me, when in reality... I just had to give it time and ""TRUST THE PROCESS.""

This post is to correct my own ignorance but also to maybe give some comfort to those who have self doubt.

I started around the end of February by joining a gym and changing my diet and counting calories.  

Since then I'm down 21 pounds.

I fully concede. This WORKS. 

I was WRONG.

If you're like me and have lost weight in the past from unsustainable ways, I understand how you may feel with not losing enough or maybe not fast enough than what you're use to, but I'm telling you. 

If you stick with this and stay consistent you WILL get there. 

You just have to deprogram yourself on everything you did in the past and accept that this is the better way to do things (counting calories).

Now, when I say that don't mean the diet. It's up to you whatever foods and diet you decide to eat. I'm more so referring to counting calories specifically. 

I used to be an idiot who truly didn't think calories mattered (Yeah LMAO) but it does.. and once you get it started and you're locked in... It's only uphill from here. 

Just know that this DOES work. Trust the process and keep going.  

I hope this helps someone out who's maybe just started and is having doubt. 

As long as you're properly counting and weighing and tracking what you eat, you will get there. It may take a while but it'll happen. 

Hope this helps.

Keep going! We all got this! ",384,45,1744993889.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k296nb/my_apology_counting_calories_does_work_and_i_was/
1k28tly,loseit,First time ever trying to lose weight and walking 10k steps a day has helped me lose 10 pounds in 3 weeks,"33 year old 5'10 sedentary male. 

First time in my adult life I've actively tried to lose weight. Was 150 last summer and went up to 175 in a few months due to some bad habits. The breaking point was all my pants no longer fit. Was pretty active as a teen but trailed off going into my early 20s. Admittedly very lazy and not a weight lifter or regular gym goer whatsoever.

Here's what I've been doing:

1.  Not eating until I've completed my 10k steps, which is usually around 4-6 PM. 
2. Only eating one meal a day along with a sweet snack after, which has averaged out to around 1100 calories. 
3. Refusing to drink calories. Been big on zero sugar soda and energy drinks. If I want coffee I'll drink it with some zero sugar vanilla creamer.



I also still eat fast food almost every day and have some kind of dessert. Chick Fil a 8 pc grilled nuggets and chicken soup is my go-to for a filling meal that is only 300 calories. 

 If I want a burger I'll go to Burger King and get a double whopper jr and some chicken fries, which together are only about 550ish calories. (shoutout to smaller sam on tik tok)

So I changed my weight loss goal to lose 100 lbs in 10 months!! That‚Äôs 10 lbs per month if I can make it. I‚Äôm really hoping that this will workout!

If not then I‚Äôll be happy with just losing 60-80 lbs because I have a good feeling about losing more weight this year than previous years!! I had a good year last year though and I lost 30 lbs, Plus 12 lbs this year so in total that‚Äôs 42 lbs.

I‚Äôm working on going to the gym 3 days a week and going for more walks on nice days. I go to the YMCA so they have a lot more to offer like the pool, sauna, basketball, gym and fitness classes. They even have two outdoor pools and a splash pad! For the summer.

I really want to lose more weight this year and I‚Äôm working towards that! I even started weight lifting even though it was a little boring but I still did a 40 minute workout yesterday and I lost 2 lbs over night from doing that and I also did 25 minutes of swimming as well.

I‚Äôm really looking forward to this weight loss journey and even the process of it all.

Also this is so inspired by Uce Gang to lose weight in 100 weeks!! But I want to do mine in 10 months.

1k27n1o,loseit,"Fluctuating weight, but not losing","I am 27F, 5'5, relatively fit, but in the last 3 years, I gained 20 pounds. I did start weight training for the first time at the beginning of this time period, which I now do very consistently and enjoy building muscle. However, I've definitely gained a lot of fat along with the muscle. I'm trying to cut down, to get rid of the fat and show the muscle I've worked to build. I'm trying to figure out my maintenance calories, but it seems like if I eat anything over 1800 cals, my weight goes up. So I'm staying at 1800 for now, although I know that's probably too low for my activity level and weight training. However, at 1800 cals and 1700 cals, my weight will get down to ~135lb then go up to 137-138ish and fluctuate between 135 and 137ish nonstop until I eventually eat over 1800cals and then it goes up for a bit before I get back to 135. I know fluctuation is normal, but it seems like I cannot get under 135. I dont want to eat less because I want to make sure I'm fueling my body. Plus, days I eat less, I usually end up on the 137ish end of things the next day, and days I eat closer to 1800, my weight usually ends up around 135 the next day. I want to get out of this cycle and get below 135. I've been unable to get below this number for over a year.

I currently get 8 to 10k steps a day, crossfit 5x a week, weight lift focused sessions on top of crossfit at least twice a week, and a short run at least twice a week. I do work from home, so im relatively sedentary during work hours. Id like to get down to 130, but even just getting under 135 would feel so rewarding. Id like to focus on leanness rather than the number on the scale, but the 135 number has me feeling so defeated. Does anyone have any advice?

1k27fmu,loseit,261.2 LBS down 32 to 229.2 LBS,"Hi everyone!


I just wanted to share a progress post :) I (28F, 5‚Äô8.5‚Äù, medium/large frame) started my weight loss journey in January after weighing in at my highest ever recorded weight, 261.2 lbs. I now do weekly weigh ins on Fridays and despite being worried I hadn‚Äôt lost anything this week due to just feeling kinda sluggish, eating a little outside my normal diet and feeling a little less strong at the gym, I lost 3.8 lbs! Just goes to show you that consistent progress does pay off. 


Here‚Äôs some detail about what I‚Äôve been doing, hopefully to anyone who finds themselves in the situation I did in January it might serve as inspiration:


-First off, I started off knowing I wanted to make this a lasting change. No drugs or crash diets, just sustainable changes for myself. No shade to people who use other methods to help get started, though. 
-I completely overhauled my diet. I was eating fast food and refined sugars all the time, hardly ever cooking and not really getting a lot of vegetables or fruit. Also drinking a lot (I worked in the service industry).


-In January I started by changing my diet. Cooking at home, using honey instead of white sugar, whole wheat flour and grain products instead of white, and focusing on adding veggies and fruits and targeting a good balance of the main macros: protein, fiber, carbs, fat. I didn‚Äôt starve myself but I did have to fight cravings a lot for the first few weeks. Now I‚Äôve learned to sit with them and brainstorm alternatives before mindlessly indulging. The first 15 lbs fell off just from changing my diet. 


-I began trying to get 15-20 minutes of walking in every day. I‚Äôve never loved going to the gym, so I didn‚Äôt want to force myself to do something I don‚Äôt like, but I wanted to get myself moving without overexerting or delaying my recovery from plantar fasciitis, which I worked on with a physical therapist. I also started going to yoga classes at my school here and there just to move and feel in touch with my body. 


-also, I was fortunate enough to be referred to an exercise program through my doctor, where I was placed with a personal trainer and have developed a weekly workout routine. Turns out the gym isn‚Äôt so bad after all. The trainer sessions meet twice a week, but I have been doing 1 or 2 additional days on my own. I do a mix of cardio and strength training: core, arms, legs, shoulders‚Ä¶ all of it. 


-I‚Äôve been doing the workouts for a solid month and some change, and I feel so much stronger. I‚Äôve been able to increase weight, reps, add things on, and sometimes even feel like I want to RUN instead of speed walking. And I always hated running. My posture has improved and I‚Äôve lost a further 15 lbs. 


-My clothes have started to fit more loosely. I still want to lose another 40-50 lbs, so I‚Äôm not going to run to the store and buy a bunch of stuff until things stabilize, but things fit more loosely and my face has slimmed down a LOT. I can squeeze into smaller spaces than I thought possible too, had to test that one in a parking garage recently.


Some days I feel really lazy or unmotivated but I just always try to compromise with myself. If I don‚Äôt want to do my full workout, I don‚Äôt let myself say no to the gym entirely (aside from a particularly acute personal stressor this past week, when I just went on different days instead). I just show up, in my workout gear, at the gym, and get on the treadmill to do my cardio. And without fail, I end up doing the rest or even just most of the rest of the workout, 
because I might as well! 

Similarly, when I‚Äôm craving junk food, I try to have a talk with myself about how I could fulfill that craving without resorting to something that will set me back. For example, one night I really wanted fried chicken. I found the healthiest frozen chicken tenders I could at the grocery and had them over some cauliflower rice with a little wing sauce. Delicious and I didn‚Äôt feel bad about it after. Cauliflower rice is my friend. It comes frozen and ready to microwave, takes basically no effort and is extremely filling as a side while still providing nutritional value and tasting good. 


That‚Äôs all! Wish me luck with the next 40-50 lbs! I‚Äôm hoping to be super confident in a bikini by August and maybe able to buy myself some new things for the fall.

Sometimes I'm happy about this, sometimes discouraged or frustrated with myself that I can't get buckle down and get to goal weight.  Especially when it's been a while since I've gotten a ""scale woosh"" thrill.

  
But last week I had to go to DMV to renew my driver's licence, got a new pic taken.

The new license just came in the mail and I can't stop staring at it.  I put it next to my old license, and the difference is spooky.  I am now 8 years older than the last time I took a DMV photo, but the new photo looks 8 years younger.  Since I always act allergic to cameras, I generally only see myself in the mirror, and while I knew my face had slimmed down, I didn't think it was that drastic.  IT IS THAT DRASTIC.  The old photo looks so puffy and miserable compared to the new one.  

It makes me want to take more photos.  It makes me wonder why I spent my 30's not getting my shit together.  It makes me happy I finally decided to get my shit together.  Would still like to see ""goal weight"" someday, but those two photos of my face side-by-side have made my whole week, even if I never hit ""goal weight.""

To anyone feeling like they're ""too old"" to make a positive change because their 30's have passed by-- do it anyway, do it, do it.

1k26fzo,loseit,Weight gain after exercise?,"For reference, I'm 5""5, 25F and 151.8lbs

I decided to start being more active so that I could try and lose the last 14lbs until my target. Up to now, I've lost all my weight through CICO and didn't exercise but I've recently started to walk more. I usually averaged 3,000 - 5,000 steps a day but last week I averaged 13,685 a day and this week I'm averaging 13,224. I've also been trying to do Just Dance twice a week because I like it and it's good exercise. Even though I've started exercising and I'm watching my calories more, I've gained 2lbs. I've weighed myself on multiple days and at multiple times and it's remained about the same.

TDEE says that my maintenance is 1,716 for sedentary and 1,967 for light exercise (I'm not sure which one I would be classed as) so I've been eating around 1300 calories a day. Also, I know it's not accurate but fitbit says I've been burning around 2,200 calories a day. So I'm definitely in a deficit. 

I had a few questions:
1. Is this 2lbs just water weight or something or am I doing something wrong? 
2. Is 1300 the right amount of calories or should I have more or less? 
3. Is just doing walking enough for exercise or do I need to be doing more? (I'm m not really a gym person and I'm already in a lot of pain just from the walking üôÉ)

1k261nu,loseit,I‚Äôll never not be shocked by how many calories certain things are,"Basically I've (26F, 5'9, 180lbs) been consistently tracking calories with a focus on protein and fiber for a little less than a month...and so far I feel really good! I started with slightly below my maintenance calories, (avg tdee according to my Garmin is about 2,700 cal) so about 2,300 and have already lowered my calorie goal to 2,100 because I just found I genuinely wasn't hungry enough at the end of the day to hit 2,300. I'm planning on trying to eventually get to 1,800-2,000 while staying as active as I currently am, but I'm in no rush as I'm really trying to shift my view on how I eat as a whole and not as a ""diet"" to temporarily bring my weight down. 

Here's the thing: I'm enjoying weighing my food, it makes me feel a lot more secure in my meal prepping and I have fun entering the different components into my app and collecting data. So far in the last 3ish weeks I've been super consistent and haven't strayed at all, which is insane for me because before I was getting constant cravings for junk, sugar, fast food, etc. and now by the end of the day I have to remind myself to eat otherwise I won't hit my protein goals. 

Last night my parents came home with a HUGE takeout container of Chinese food-- probably a pound of sesame chicken, wontons, rice, and egg rolls. They don't eat leftovers so usually it's all just free food for me and I inhale it without a second thought! I didn't eat any last night and this morning when I woke up I found myself almost salivating over the thought of it for the first time since I started my healthier eating and I decided to let myself have a little plate as my first ""meal"" of the day rather than my regular breakfast....

650 calories for literally 1/3 of what I would normally eat without thinking! And only 19g of protein, very little fiber, tons of sugar, lots of fat. Don't get me wrong, it was delish, but WOWWWWW 

I really used to think ""I hardly eat, I don't know how I'm maintaining/ gaining weight while I'm so active"" but actually tracking all my food without a toxic/ unrealistic expectation behind it has really opened my eyes in a positive way. 

Basically, I just feel really satisfied with myself that I was able to not only stop at one plate, but really track all that was on the plate with absolutely no guilt and a better perspective on WHY certain foods are better choices for my diet instead of just demonizing everything and restricting until I binge with no control and feel like shit for days. Don't have any friends who would care irl so I thought I'd share here <3

I‚Äôm new here and just wanted to share something that really helped me after trying (and failing) multiple times to lose weight.

I realized my biggest issue wasn‚Äôt diet or exercise ‚Äî it was consistency and overwhelm. I used to jump from one YouTube routine to another, try keto for a week, then give up.

What helped me:

Breaking down my goals weekly (not just ‚Äúlose 10kg‚Äù)

Simple daily habits like walking 30 mins + tracking food

Finding a structured plan that actually made sense (instead of random advice)


In 30 days, I‚Äôve lost about 5 pounds and more importantly, I feel in control now.

Not saying I‚Äôm an expert, but if anyone‚Äôs in that ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where to start‚Äù zone ‚Äî feel free to ask anything. I‚Äôd love to share what worked (and what didn‚Äôt).

1k23si2,loseit,"It's stupid, but I need to vent","Okay so some background. I'm a 28 y/o F with PCOS. I spent years yo-yo dieting and ultimately was diagnosed with ADHD & binge eating disorder in my early 20s. I usually fluctuated about 40 LBs every 8 months or so peaking at around 260 LBs and tapering off around 220 LBs before ultimately going back up. Last year was an all time low for me. I hit 302 LBs, the highest I've ever been in my life. I felt so miserable, I was embarrassed to leave the house... nothing fit, I couldn't shop in regular stores anymore, I was just.. horribly embarrassed to be who I was at that point. I decided to change, I started calorie counting, eating more veggies, and exercising daily starting in Jan 2024. At this point I've gone from 302 LBs to 204 LBs. A year and a half and I'm down nearly 100 LBs and still going. 

Here's the rant:

I know it's so stupid. I know I'm getting hung up on numbers.. but I don't know why I still feel this way.. why am I so ashamed of myself? It feels like every thing I can do is offset by my weight. Got a promotion? Cool, wouldve been better if you were skinnier. Helped a friend? Cute, they'd appreciate it more if you were thin. Got a new outfit? Well it would definitely look better if you lost more weight. It never stops. Is this what binge eating disorder is? And the thing that's like.. eating away at me is that when I was heavier, losing 5-7 LBs a month was a breeze... now that I'm down to where I am, I'm stalling.. going up and down a few LBs every few days. even after adjusting my routine and being strick with my diet, I'm barely seeing a 5 LB weight loss every few months... in Jan I was 215 LBs, now in April I'm 204 LB, so I'm only averaging about 2.5 LBs a month.. 

My ""healthy"" weight according to BMI is 150 LBs, but I personally think that sounds very low for me.. my ultimate goal weight was 180 LB that was when I'd start maintenance... but idk.. I have my calories set to 1350 a day. I exercise 5 days a week doing cardio for nearly 2 hours and a half hour or weight training. I eat tons of veggies and low calorie snacks when I'm feeling picky and I rarely order out. I even make myself do my routine when I'm not feeling well... like I push myself so hard... and then part of me is so scared like this is it.. this is the best my body can do and I am just stuck here for the rest of my life.. working my ass off to maintain a potatoe body. 

I'm not exaughsted.. like I'm not giving up or anything, but... I'm frustrated and maybe just being a little hard on myself... but it was nice to vent.. I'm obviously open to advice, but I usually don't get much interactions on posts like this.. it was more just to get my thoughts down and out of my head, ya know?..",6,2,1744979496.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k23si2/its_stupid_but_i_need_to_vent/
1k24w7z,loseit,What does body positivity and fat positivity mean to you?,"Losing weight has been a lifelong battle for me, as for many of you. I've come far from my highest weight and rubber-banded to the beat of life's trials. Losing weight is important to me and my sense of health. There is an element of vanity, for sure, but having struggled with aching joints, brain fog and sleep apnea, I will always consider myself body positive but I don't feel I can extend that to being fat positive or the healthy fat movement.
  
I'm currently in a good place, mostly, and have started dating someone who is heavier than I am, but supports me, takes no issue with my weight loss journey and shows me every respect. That said, I struggle to return that grace to them as being fat positive is just not my experience. I've not made any negative remarks to them and would never insist they make any lifestyle changes. I've learnt myself that you have to want it yourself. But I find myself staying silent when they talk about being 'healthy at any weight' when I see them struggling with similar issues when I was their size.  

Ahead of asking them to share what these terms mean to them and inviting a larger discussion, I wanted to see how this specific community defines these two terms to see if I'm misunderstanding, thanks.",1,23,1744982776.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k24w7z/what_does_body_positivity_and_fat_positivity_mean/

I decided to lose another 30lbs and reach 165-170lbs (my GW) As I realized I am still overweight and quite bulky 5-6 months ago. During my first weightloss journey (2.5 years ago) I was following a standard diet of around 1600-1700 calories which consisted of chicken rice and veggies without any supplements not even whey protein and no exercise. But during the second weightloss journey 5-6 months ago I followed the same diet I followed during the first time but only this time I started taking whey protein on top of it with no exercise, as a Result i developed constipation due to which my stools were very hard and very hard to pass this continued for a month and I developed hemorrhoids due to which I had to stop my weight loss journey. I healed somewhat in the 2-3 weeks. Dr. Adviced me to stop taking whey protein. After a month of dealing with this I started my weightloss journey again with the same diet minus the whey protein for a week and I was fine the first week but during the second week I got very hard stools again which flared up the hemorrhoids again. I had to stop again for a month to heal. This exact same thing repeated again twice. The last time I started  the weightloss journey for the nth time I replaced rice with oats or whole wheat for fiber and I had the opposite issue very small stools and hard to pass which required a lot of straining due to which i got another flare-up but this was not that bad healed within a week. So I am scared to start the weightloss journey again because everytime I start I get constipated due to which I get flareups which just derails the entire progress. I just feel stuck not knowing where to go from here please help me correct this. Also during my last diet my meals included 1 banana, 2-3 carrots, sometimes bellpeppers, oats or whole wheat carb source and a bunch of other fruites for fiber. I have been dying to lose weight since the last 5 months and haven't been able to for this reason.

After years of yo-yo dieting and binge-crash cycles, I've finally found a way that is sustainable to me. Honestly my mistake the entire time was trying to cut out all the unhealthy foods completely. Now I'm much more focused on finding a better way to have the foods I love without overdoing it.

So instead of a Large Dominos Pizza, 2 sides and a full sugar coke, I have half of a cheap frozen pizza,  a serving of wedges with some Pepsi Max.

Instead of a large five guys fries and cheeseburger, I make a cheeseburger at home and have a serving of fries.

The calorie saving from that alone is amazing. And I've recently found a love of playing just dance, I've done an hour every day for the past 8 days (taking today off as a rest day). But it feels great to be exercising without feeling like it's exercise!

I've been sat at 109.6KG for a few days now, and hope that the loss starts moving again soon. My body likely just tired from a lack of rest days so far.

This worries me because part of my excersize has been strength training, which she knows and didn't object to, and while I've never been overly muscley when we first got together I did strength training regularly and was pretty strong.

Generally I'm a quite active person and always hovered around 95kg for the last few years. This year it got kind of out of hand as I spent more time behind my desk and less outdoors and surfing. Got to 108kg and decided something needed to change.  Male 27. 185cm tall

What am I doing?

2250 calories a day, meals spread over 4-5 meals throughout the day. First meal is after morning workout. Averaging 163g protein, 238g carbs, 58g fats over the last week. Although I try to aim for 197g protein. Got protein powder coming in to aid with this.

10.000-13.000 steps a day

mon-friday weight/resistance training 30-50 minutes per workout.

Start the day off with a walk, wake up at 6, walk at 6 30, followed by the gym.

In addition I go out surfing when there's waves or go play golf when the weather is good, golf just adds to the step count, when I play I easily break 15k for the day. Don't track the surfing, usually 1-2 hours, at the moment due to lack of waves maybe once a week, same for golf.

Initially it seems like that the start of the day might be the issue, but to be fair my body has adjusted well to this part of the routine. I wake up at 6 without the help of an alarm and get to bed at 9-9:30pm. Get to sleep around 22:00

4 weeks into doing this consistently without fail, started at 108kg and now at 100.8, doing the above.

Week 1: 108 -->105.5

Week 2: 105.5 --> 103.9

Week 3: 103.9 --> 102.8

Week 4: 102.8 --> 100.8

I just find my energy crashes a lot during the day, usually around midday/after food. And I almost always need a short nap, which I want to avoid as it interferes with work. (I am self employed so I can manage it but it just leads to me working later to manage the workload effectively.)

I don't think my calories are that low, my exercise is moderate to active I would say and the weight lifting sessions dont wreck me, I stick to 3 RIR on most exercises and do 4-5 exercises for 2 sets of 15 every day. mon-fri. Saturday-sunday recovery.

What I will do next week is a deload week on the weights so I can go a bit harder the week following.

But yeah, what can I do to reduce fatigue during the day? I feel like I am doing everything right, but the fatigue during the day is getting into the way of work productivity.

Other than that if feels sustainable what I am doing, I dont feel overly hungry, enjoy the activity, just want to increase my work productivity whilst prioritizing my health.

1k224ki,loseit,"Losing the weight, gaining it back and then trying to lose it again","Hello, I'm going through quite a process here, something that i dont have anyone to talk to in my personal life about so i thought i'd share it here. Last year in 2024 I lost 16kgs, the year before i had lost over 25kgs, my starting weight was 140kg. Things were going really well i was down to 99kg and loving it, so close to my goal weight of 87kgs. Somehow someway christmas was right around the corner, and allll that holiday food started coming in, and then it was New years eve/day celebrations, and being hungover and havin greasy food woul fix it, and then it was my birthday and then all of sudden i wasn't 99kg anymore. I had gained 5kgs over 3 months, I weighed in at 104kgs in March, I decided it's time to get back on track and then at the end of march I weighed in at 110Kgs i was very scared and started training again.   
  
I've now just weighed in at 107kgs and im just feeling a little upset, and disappointed with myself. Some days going to the gym feels like the weight of the world is on my back, i used to love the gym and i still do, but even though i know im doing it for my health and for myself, i cant find the motivation to move. On some days i force myself to go and i do but most days that doesnt work, i try to substitue for perhaps a low intensity youtube workout on pilates or dancing or whatever but even then i feel like im not doing enough and almost dont do it, as if im saying well whats the point.  
  
This feeling has become so big and overwhelming that although i know doing something is better than doing nothing, i still can't quite get myself there, im confused on where the motion has gone, not so long ago i was actively in the gym and actively going on walks and meal prepping, but now i feel like i've been defeated and i cant get back up. 

Im not sure if anyone can relate or has been here before but any tips, suggestions or experiences would be greatly appreicated as i really just cant see the point anymore. ",4,3,1744973880.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k224ki/losing_the_weight_gaining_it_back_and_then_trying/

1k21fs3,loseit,Fat Bump on Back of the head,"Hey yall!,

A couple of days ago i noticed that a fat bump has ""appeared"" on the back of my head.. i never really noticed this and havent see it in other pictures of me. I weigh 82kg and I am 180cm tall.

I gained maybe about 2kg in the last 3 months but i doubt that this alone is the origin of this bump.Again, i dont see it in pictures of me from 6-12 months ago where i weighed about the same as i do now.. 

Have you experienced this yourself? And can it go away with weight loss?  
It makes me insecure because it makes my hairstyle look off from the side view. 

Do you guys think that losing a bit of weight is enough or may the cause be something different ?

Edit: I'm not tracking calories bc once I get over my cal limit I just say fuck it and binge everything.

1k1wt46,loseit,Maintenance,"I‚Äôd like to really start my journey (190lbs-130ish) and im thinking about counting my calories? 14f, i just need advice on whether its a good idea. I understand that im still growing and in my current position i‚Äôd like to avoid disordered eating. My main goals are

-Become happier in my body, gain general confidence.

-be more athletic, faster, more stamina and strength, stuff like that.

-Just generally being kinder with myself and repairing my relationship with food.

My current plan is to eat about 1500 calories a day? Im not very active so i think it should be plenty although im honestly not sure if i even should count my calories. Ive been trying to eat less processed foods, which means i need to start making my own lunchs and breakfasts intead of eating the schools, which i can track easily, but i usually dont make my own dinner, so it would be somewhat difficult to track. I‚Äôd like to walk for about 30 minutes everyday, but i cant drive so pacing around in my room is the best i got.

I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice you guys may have for me, i understand im young and am still growing but i‚Äôd still like to lose weight.

1k1webb,loseit,Dress Ripped- mental snapping point today,"Hi folks- I just began my first full time job almost a year ago and have put on about 10-15 pounds since. I am just below 200 lbs, I‚Äôm a former D1 softball player, and did powerlifting for a long time, so I‚Äôve always had a good amount of muscle. Built for power, not speed. 

I‚Äôve had many severe weight fluctuations over the years of college ball, high school, and now with the weight gain. 

I go on the occasional walk for exercise at work, and usually workout 5 days a week after work or on weekends. 

I went to a networking event today with this beautiful new dress. I fit into it well, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it suffocating or anything, I made sure to try sitting with it in the changing room for a while since the material doesn‚Äôt have much give. Then as soon as I sat down, the zipper split all the way open. Fortunately I had a cover up and my friend helped with a pin, and she said it was easy to pin together so the dress wasn‚Äôt too small for me. It was very easy to get on in the first place. She believes it‚Äôs the fabric and quality- and there‚Äôs probably some truth to that, I also lost two buttons (decorative) just by walking around and having them hit my purse. 

But I‚Äôm having this realization moment- that my weight (muscle or fat) is impacting my ability to wear the clothes I want, to enjoy myself at events and feel confident, to try something on at the store and feel good about myself. I think it just snapped me mentally. 

1) I‚Äôm pissed I paid as much as I did for a poor quality dress 
2) I‚Äôm having to live with the build I have regardless of my ‚Äúsize‚Äù I come from generations of farmers, we‚Äôre all broad shouldered and stocky, I‚Äôve never been meant to have the tall and lean body- I‚Äôm ok with that #shortqueen
3) despite being beautiful tonight (I had my hair, nails, and a tan) the dress was a nice color too, my night was ruined by the pressure my weight put on the dress. Not that I was too fat, not that it doesn‚Äôt look good on my figure, but the total weight/pressure made it rip. 

I‚Äôve had it. And I had to say it here to people who understand. I didn‚Äôt want to beg for an honest answer from friends, my bf, or parents who won‚Äôt tell me to my face that I‚Äôm overweight even if I‚Äôm pretty in the face or have nice hair. Weight is weight- I‚Äôm not shredded but I do have muscle still. Regardless, that number on the scale is going to drop by the end of this year. 

This was my wake up call, what was yours? ",24,5,1744950359.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k1webb/dress_ripped_mental_snapping_point_today/

For example, the fat or leanness of ground beef can heavily influence the calories, so I use an average that skews a little conservative.  Committing these to memories just takes the stress of weighing and looking up everything out of it.


-Fat (oil/butter) 1 Tbsp:  100 kcal

-Egg 1 medium:  50 kcal

-Ground Beef/Sausage 1/4 lb:  300 kcal

-Bacon 1 strip:  100 kcal

-Meat Lean Cut 1/4 lb:  150 kcal

-Potato 1 medium:  200 kcal

-Rice 1/2 cup:  350 kcal

-Pasta 1/4 lb:  400 kcal

im moving to a very walkable city. i will have two jobs, both of which are walking distance to me, and one of which will involve walking 2-4 miles a shift. i‚Äôll be able to walk to the store, cafes, parks, the train station, shops. i‚Äôll be walking a bunch. also my apartment is on the fourth floor and theres no elevator. i may not have time to workout with both jobs but ill still be very active.

im wondering if anybody whos lived or moved to a walkable city during their fitness/weigh loss journey noticed it having a big impact? even without being on a calorie deficit? im eating at maintenance calories now.

i go on a lot of walks here but its not like i can walk to the store. if i walk its for the sake of walking, not because theres a destination. but im remembering my college years and how i lost weight my freshman year because i was walking so much all of a sudden. and that was long before i gained weight so i wasnt at all paying attention to my calories. if anyone can weigh in on this id love to hear your experience.

1k1sn2d,loseit,Any advice for losing weight when I have reactive hypoglycemia and have already tried so many strategies?,"I‚Äôm 5‚Äô3.5‚Äù inches tall, currently 135 lbs, and approximately 24-25% body fat percentage. I‚Äôd like to at least get back down to 125 lbs, but 120 would be even better. 

What I‚Äôm struggling with is that I have to stay under 1400 calories a day (around 1375 or less) to see any weight loss at all, but I also have to eat a balanced snack or small meal every 3-ish hours as part of my hypoglycemia management/prevention diet plan. If I try to push it longer, I crash and get super symptomatic and then have to eat even more calories to bring my blood sugar back up than I would have if I‚Äôd just eaten sooner. This feels like an impossible combination so much of the time. 

I used to like the feeling of being slightly hungry/empty, but since having hypoglycemia, it‚Äôs a horribly triggering sensation because I know what happens very soon afterwards if I don‚Äôt eat. 

I can‚Äôt eat even a small dessert without hurting my health unless I eat it after a balanced meal, so I can‚Äôt replace a snack or meal with dessert anymore if I‚Äôd like a treat. This makes it feel like I have no choice but to go over my daily calorie goal if I want to enjoy the occasional treat. 

It‚Äôs also hard to stay on top of counting calories every day because I make all of my and my family‚Äôs meals from scratch and it takes a long time to add the recipes to MyFitnessPal accurately. 

What I‚Äôm already trying:
- Prioritizing protein and healthy fat (I get around 90-100 grams of protein a day, which is a good bit at my height and weight)
- Eating low glycemic carbohydrates only and prioritizing fiber
- No added sugar, except the rare/occasional treat out with my husband (if I make dessert at home it‚Äôs always grain-free and made with a substitute like allulose)
- Smaller meals or balanced snacks every 3-ish hours
- No alcohol (and I only drink water)
- Counting calories in My Fitness Pal to the best of my ability 
- Exercising 40-45 minutes a day (one 20-minute walk and one 20-minute strength conditioning/physical therapy session) *I have POTS, so even though it‚Äôs well controlled, I have limits on the type and amount of exercise I can do 
- I also should have high NEAT, as I fidget a lot and do at least a couple of hours of housework and cooking daily 

*I do feel like I‚Äôve built up a good bit of muscle, so that‚Äôs one positive. 

I would really appreciate any tips or advice or encouragement! 

What happened is that I gained around 15 lbs between fall of 2022 and August of 2024, due to pretty severe undiagnosed hypoglycemia. I've always eaten a very nutritious, healthy diet and exercised regularly, so the only thing that changed during that time was needing to eat a lot more to mitigate my (then unexplained) low blood sugar symptoms. 

After getting diagnosed with hypoglycemia last August and discovering how severe it was, I was able to get it under control with diet alterations like adding back in meat and eggs to increase my protein after being vegan for five years, limiting the amount and type of carbohydrates I eat (low glycemic only), and eating smaller amounts more frequently instead of larger meals. Thankfully getting the hypoglycemia under control stopped my weight gain completely. The highest I got up to before getting diagnosed was around 136-137 lbs at 5‚Äô3.5‚Äù. 

Since then I‚Äôve been able to get down to about 135 lbs and maintain that, but just haven‚Äôt been able to lose more no matter what I try. Prior to this issue, I maintained 120 lbs (give or take a few) just by eating healthy/nutritious food, eating intuitively, and doing physical activity I enjoyed. I never had to count calories. I am so frustrated! I feel like my body is broken, and even though I‚Äôm not technically overweight, I do not feel my best at this weight or body fat percentage.

1k1r33r,loseit,[Tip] Find healthy swaps at restaurants if possible,"One of the things that I have struggled with throughout my weight loss journey is dining out and eating things that are packed with calories like cheeseburgers, burritos, pizza, etc.  I have lost 30-35 pounds and have hit a plateua due to relapsing and eating out more than I should. A tip that I have recently used when I went out to eat was getting things that are low calorie like a chicken sandwich or a chicken salad. I find that I feel just as full eating those things as I would be if I ate a burger and that I also stay full for longer periods of time since it has more protein. It also is surprisingly quite good.

There are two things which can make it more difficult. The first simply is budgeting to which if it's too expensive to get compared to other options as salads and grilled chicken sandwiches tend to cost more then one way is to either budget or eat out less all around. The second concern pertaining to salads at restaurants are that they are loaded with dressings and croutons. What I have found to be helpful has been getting a salad with just grilled chicken and cheese which cuts down on a lot of the calories that would come with it otherwise.  The grilled chicken that comes with it on top is also pretty good and for me at least makes it taste good even without other things like croutons or dressing.",1,2,1744933219.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k1r33r/tip_find_healthy_swaps_at_restaurants_if_possible/

When I feel fine, I stick to my calories and get movement and workouts in and can lose 1-2 lbs a week. But I have chronic neck and shoulder pain, and catch a cold that 80% of the time turns into bronchitis at least 3-4 times a year. Last year I got COVID and then had bronchitis 5 separate times in  a row for 6 months üò≠ And then I got BPPV vertigo which made me have migraines and dizziness for 8 months and it just came back again, along with the neck and facial pain. I‚Äôve spent a year trying to get medical help and trying to get back on the horse and it keeps tearing its ugly head, or I get a cold and feel miserable. 

It‚Äôs so hard knowing how healthy I once was and finding it impossible to stay consistent in the face of injury and pain and illness. I eat healthy foods, but am extremely sedentary when I feel hurt or sick, and during those times I don‚Äôt track because I‚Äôm just trying to feel good enough to go to work and not use up all my PTO. This isn‚Äôt about motivation it‚Äôs more a burnout from being sick and not having the mental capacity to push through.

Does anyone else deal with this and what keeps you going? I don‚Äôt ever plan on giving up on myself but I‚Äôm just exhausted and desperately wish I could have just 6 months where I don‚Äôt get sick or don‚Äôt have severe untreatable pain. I‚Äôm just so tired.

I exercise plenty: 15 minutes of mixed cardio + 30 minutes of either weight training / core training / pilates, in the morning + 45 minutes of walking in the evenings (approx pace 12-13 mins/km). Apple Watch says I burn around 700 - 800 Move calories on weekdays (when I work) and \~900 when I'm home on Saturday, and \~600 on Sundays, when I take a rest day usually.

Assuming my TDEE is about 2200 for a week's average, I should be seeing some changes in weight if I'm eating 1700-1800 calories a day, but NOPE. Nada. I understand water retention and losing water weight quick in the beginning, then plateauing (not my first rodeo). 

But this is frustrating as HELL. I haven't lost ANY weight in 2 whole weeks and I've been watching what I eat like a HAWK. I count calories, and I also prioritise fruit as snacks instead of anything else, eat plenty of fibre, focus on home cooked foods. My calorie counting is pretty accurate as I've been checking each ingredient's calories as well when I cook, and quantities. I may be off by about \~100 each day, but no more than that. I even count the calories in my supplements.

I have PCOS and I've always had it (diagnosed at 14). I've started supplements since December and while they have helped with a lot (my period is now almost completely regular and painless, my moon face is decreasing, less stomach issues), they haven't done anything for my weight.

My problem when it comes to doing exercises at home is that I feel like it's not going to work and thus I can't motivate myself to stick to a routine. I need solid evidence that i can tone myself with whatever routine I do, and doing arm raises and sit ups (just examples) gives me nothing.

I really just want to be happy in my body. Before starting my efforts, I had no food noise, didn‚Äôt really workout except for squash practice 4x a week, and ate whatever I wanted without much thought. But I‚Äôve always been insecure of my body because of having more body fat than my friends. Last February I began my journey - starting with eating healthier and then transferring to counting the calories of everything I was eating in the notes app. I switched between 1400-1750 calories throughout the months. I was using a scale to weigh my food so it was very accurate. I was also exercising 6 days a week. I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time but I lost a little weight (looking back at pictures my face was thinner). However, by May I had gone insane thinking I had no progress and was restricted so I stopped. After this, I was binging all the time after being so restricted and I gained 10-15 pounds. In mid-July I really hated the way I looked even more so I decided to start my journey again. I ate 1500 calories but would save 600-700 for ultra-processed desserts. I thought this would help with the cravings. Alas, I did not lose any weight. In November I ate bigger meals (so eating less dessert) still in the deficit. On vacation I would go crazy and majorly overeat because ‚ÄúI was on vacation.‚Äù January 1st I decided to only eat whole foods and use MyFitnessPal to track fats and carbs as well. Still no weight loss so in February I started gradually increasing my calories until I reached 2000, thinking that my body has adjusted to lower calories. I gained a bit of weight. Throughout the August-March time frame if I ate out to dinner, I would binge afterwards because of the restriction. This would happen once every 2 weeks, approximately. For three weeks now I‚Äôve been eating 1750 calories, 100g of protein, 230g of carbs, and 60g of fat. Whole foods only, barely anything processed. I track everything using my scale, so I am positive it is accurate. I have not binged, but one night in the three weeks I ate dinner out, so went way past the deficit. I‚Äôm still working out 6 days a week. I also have barely gained muscle in this past year despite doing 3 days of weightlifting, 2 days of cardio, and 1 day of pilates, plus squash twice a week (it‚Äôs shifted a bit through the year but still similar). I get over 10K steps everyday and drink 40oz of water at least, normally more. I get 7-9 hours of good sleep. A few weeks ago I got my hormones tested. I‚Äôm a bit insulin resistant at 2.2 HOMA-IR, but no other issues in my hormones. I‚Äôm also on birth control and have been for 3 years, and I do face a few issues regarding my period being constant, but I didn‚Äôt gain weight when initially on it. I‚Äôm not really that stressed out either, though the food noise is crazy and always around. It seems as though I‚Äôm doing everything perfectly yet I can‚Äôt lose weight and it really sucks!!! I know this is long but if anyone has any advice I would appreciate it so greatly. I‚Äôve done so much research but have learned nothing that would help me. 

Edit: I know I‚Äôm still a teenager but I‚Äôm looking to do this in a healthy way because I just want to be happy with myself. I‚Äôm doing this for me, not for other people. So please give me advice! ",0,8,1744914721.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k1k3cf/weight_loss_impossible/

1. Am I losing to much weight to fast? I'm not starving or anything I actually eat everything I want to eat along as I'm under. (Halo Ice-cream 1-2 times a week) but not sure if I this is all water weight or if im actually losing weight. I am currently tracking calories at 1900 per day and somedays go over 50-100 if I get hungry.
2. I am not working out besides playing airsoft on some weekends and playing football in at the park with my brothers. My goal weight is 185 and I wasn't going to start lifting till I hit my goal before summer so I can at least look good before I start adding calories/ protein to build more muscle. Should I start now, or does it not make a difference if I wait.
3. after I get to my goal weight how much calories should I go to just maintain/ I guess build muscle if I want to. Not sure if I want to keep the deficit since I've heard it making you lose muscle.
4. Since my end goal is June 30th should I lower calories if it was just water weight and im doing it healthy and have nothing to worry about and just want to hit my goal?
5. What's a good way to check a exact body fat %?

I get insomnia for a few nights, feel bone-tired, freezing, bloated and STARVING with monster carb cravings. Once I have a sweet or few in the day, the rest of the day is worthless. And once I have ""fail"" one day, my cravings are 100x worse for the next few days. I have never pushed through. I have given up every time. I tell myself I'll never be able to lose weight any way and I should not even try. I tend to stay pretty hourglass-y even at this weight and my husband honestly still loves the way I look, so I tell myself I can be happy at this weight.

I am now facing my period coming in the next few days. These are the strategies am going to try to distract myself from the hunger and cravings and make it through without giving up. 

* Walking 
* Reading: a good romantacy book I can escape into
* Napping: I'll restructure my routine for the first few days around my period to at least lay down during ALL of his naps even if I don't fall asleep
* Sex

1k1grrh,loseit,Tantrum Thursday,"I have been weighing out all my food before eating. I was feeling great about it until yesterday.
 I remembered reading a post about weighing before cooking. I just skimmed over it and thought it probably didn't make a difference. I did a little more research on it yesterday and now I can't stop thinking about how inaccurately I have been counting calories all month. 

How do I move forward?
 It seems the process of weighing before cooking is way more complicated. 
Am I right in thinking that in order to accurately weigh my portion I need to 
1. Calculate the calories and weight for each individual raw ingredient that is in the dish.
2.Add up all calories and weight total
3.Cook the dish
4.Weigh the entire cooked dish(Seriously how big is y'all's food scale)
5.Decide how many portions are in the dish.
6.Divide the weight and calories of each ingredient by the number of portions in the dish
7.Weigh out the individual cooked meal based on the weight of one portion of the dish.

I am in tears and binged on two breakfast tacos this morning.
Is it really this complicated? Are there ways of making it easier that I may not be considering?",0,11,1744906598.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k1grrh/tantrum_thursday/
1k1gp3t,loseit,Dating as a woman with loose skin,"Frustrated and just need to get this out. I‚Äôm 33F and live in NYC, which already makes dating hard enough - but the extra element of my body and being perceived after substantial weight loss is just a LOT. 

I‚Äôve lost almost 200 lbs since my HW, and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell when I‚Äôm fully clothed. I‚Äôm about 3 years out from sleeve surgery but I still have substantial loose skin. You can see it in my biceps, my thighs, my stomach, definitely my breasts. It hangs and folds and ripples. Not a comical amount but like, it‚Äôs there and there‚Äôs no avoiding it. It‚Äôs honestly worse right now because I‚Äôm technically underweight for my height and dealing with another eating disorder but that‚Äôs a different subject‚Ä¶but I know all this and I accept this about myself and my body, and ideally I want to have surgery to fix what I‚Äôm most insecure about. 

The last few guys I‚Äôve dated, things quickly end once we have sex for the first time. I even tell them during the initial dating that I‚Äôve lost a great deal of weight, some of them make the ‚Äúconnection‚Äù that I‚Äôll have loose skin and some don‚Äôt. But I‚Äôm also not an idiot - there‚Äôs absolutely NO way that I‚Äôm connecting with all of these men, and I will wait many dates/weeks before being physical, and then almost immediately after we have sex I‚Äôll get curbed for some random reason that doesn‚Äôt align with our initial chemistry. It has become an ongoing joke at this point in my friend circle. It‚Äôs the loose skin. Nobody has the nerve to say it to my face, but like I said, I‚Äôm not an idiot and I know it. 

I‚Äôve done strength training which has helped a bit, but I still have a lot of loose skin. And I feel like I have to put this part of my life with dating on hold until I ‚Äúfix‚Äù my body. And I HATE that. I hate feeling that way about myself. 

I want to be idealistic, and say tHe RiiGhT oNe wOnT cArE!!! But you know, everyone deserves to be attracted to their partner. And right now I‚Äôm just not attractive with my body apparently. So then comes the other layer of, dropping thousands of dollars just to appease a man I‚Äôve never even met before that will judge a version of me that doesn‚Äôt even exist yet. I hate feeling like I have to change my body for male acceptance. At least when I was heavy, men knew this getting to know me and there was no ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù when I got naked. 

Sorry for being negative, I‚Äôm just in a bad headspace because this has happened back to back a few times now after I took off about 8 months from dating because the same thing was happening before. I‚Äôm genuinely considering taking out loans that I cannot afford just to fix a body that I don‚Äôt even want to do anything else to, to appease people I don‚Äôt even know yet. Society is fucked towards women, innit?

1k1ex66,loseit,Fatigue & Weight loss,"Hello!!

I just wanted to write and ask if anyone had tips on how to lose weight with fatigue. I am 19F and 5ft 6, 215 lbs, but I also build muscle very fast so I don't look my weight if that makes sense. I am also in college so I try to eat as healthy as possible but it can be very difficult especially because I have a really bad sweet tooth. I am on iron pills for low ferritin, so we are hoping that helps with my energy. I am also on birth control and some depression and anxiety meds that might effect weight. (I have ADHD & Chronic Depression) Working out is super difficult for me and I was just wondering if anyone had any tips.

1k1etch,loseit,hate my body after weight loss.,"I worked so hard to lose all the weight and honestly I still hate how I look. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 20f I went from 235lbs to 152lbs and I still feel like I need to lose more weight. My stomach especially is the area I hate the most. My stomach has fat still but I also feel like it has a small amount of loose skin, so it almost looks a tiny bit saggy sometimes which i absolutely hate. Like my stomach is very giggly and i seriously hate it so much. 

I‚Äôve been maintaining my weight loss for about 7 months now. Every single day I think about how I still hate my body. I‚Äôve never had confidence because I was bullied as a kid. I used to be 120lbs when I was like 13 and i genuinely thought I was fat at that time, until I put on a ton of weight and realized I was perfect at 120. But now at 152 I feel huge. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve tired to start a calorie deficit again but I just get so hungry i end up only being in a 300 calorie deficit.

1. Finally threw my broken IKEA chair and got something ergonomic, and switched to sit stand desk. Sitting felt less like punishment and standing during long calls helped me focus way more. Saved me from scatica

2. I eat 2 large meals a day. Media always tells us to eat more frequent and smaller meals, but I've found that fasting helps, and so does this approach. I help me feel lighter, works with my digestion. I lost 2 lbs so far

3. I've started blocking out ""nothing"" time in my calendar. Time with no agenda, just the freedom to be, to breath and practice awareness.



I get so involved in making the changes that I hardly notice in focus and energy until things got better. I started wondering have any of you made small changes that helped your brain kick into gear? whether it's from tools or habits

I'm not fat per se, but I have belly fat. Apart from that I'm kind of skinny (effect of more carbs than protein due to regional diet and sedantory work)

I was consistent to an extent, but suddenly, I cut slack and ever since I'm not following diet, stopped going to MMA and I'm back to 85kgs, my face puffed up like before.

I feel bad about myself. I understand I'm addicted to the taste of food, but what I don't understand is why I got lazy and stopped with my mma sessions. I'm not tracking my calories anymore too nor I'm minding increased protein intake.

1k1de4e,loseit,Gained it all back - starting over,"Hey guys first time posting here. 25F 5‚Äò4‚Äú semi athletic build.

My weight gain/loss journey goes like this: in 2018 during my freshman year of college I was 161 lbs. I was overweight and out of shape so basically no muscle weight. I began to work out more, etc. and started to lose weight. This slowly developed into an eating disorder, particularly when Covid hit. My lowest weight was 127 lbs.  After Covid/graduating, I slowly began to gain back more weight because it was unsustainable/detrimental etc.

I have recovered from my ED. Since 2023, I have made changes to my lifestyle to overcome it and even got professional help from a dietitian last year to break the few habits that I couldn‚Äôt break myself. I saw a Personal Trainer earlier this year for a couple months to help me get back into weightlifting. At this point, I have gained back all the weight I lost five years ago. I am following the stereotypical post ED weight gain timeline. The difference between now and 2018 is that I am fit, but I am also overweight. I know that I am overweight because muscle versus fat gain is easy to distinguish and I got a body fat composition test done by my PT. My weight is not fluctuating, it‚Äôs been increasing and doesn‚Äôt go away.

This is my current workout routine: 
- M/W I do Pilates at home before work and then go to the gym to lift for an hour after work
- T/TH I run a 5K in my neighborhood.
- weekends I run or do Pilates when I have the time. 

I have an office job so I‚Äôm pretty sedentary all day and I don‚Äôt feel like I am pushing myself too much with my exercise routine above. I am sleeping pretty well, I meal prep my lunches/dinners, I don‚Äôt go out to eat a ton, and I generally stay away from processed/fast foods. I do have a sweet tooth, but this is now under control thanks to my time seeing the dietician last year. I am not a heavy drinker. 

My question to you all is what do I do from here on out? My clothes continue to get tighter, I  don‚Äôt like the way I look, I have confirmation that I am overweight and I‚Äôm annoyed. I just want to lose fat. I don‚Äôt care about the number on the scale. My exercise routine is good. My eating habits are not disordered, but clearly something needs to change. I know that diet/time are probably key to achieving my goals, but I am unsure what to do since I‚Äôve been consistent for months and months and only achieve the opposite of what I want. 

I‚Äôm not happy where I am but I need to make sustainable changes somewhere. I may just find another dietician to help but I thought I would ask here first. ",2,3,1744898106.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k1de4e/gained_it_all_back_starting_over/

Coming to the title of this post, I‚Äôve been a mouth breather all my life too. Being overweight and having sinusitis always led me to breathe from my mouth. I tried nasal breathing but it just never worked if I didn‚Äôt keep a check on my breathing. 

I still breathe from my mouth and I had this sudden thought of googling about mouth breathing linked to weight loss. The answer shocked me. It said yes, it affects weight loss and makes it harder to lose weight.

1k199ty,loseit,Instantaneous plateau,"Hello.

22M, 193cm (6'3), SW 124kg (273lb)

I've been on a strict regimen for going on 5 weeks now, which includes a 1500 calorie a day limit, (don't count macros or limit what I eat, only changed to acceptable portions) and daily bodyweight exercises.

I've managed to mostly keep on track with everything, only exceptions are 4 - 5 days where I passed my limit, but remained decently below 2300 (BMR Maintenance), 2 days where I passed BMR maintenance (going out, still not going overboard), and 2 days where I didn't exercise for recovery.

I've not relied on weighing myself until recently, which has left me utterly dissapointed, almost consistently I've remained exactly on 124kg for the week, only once has it read 121, but the consistent higher results have made me think that it was some sort of weighing mistake on my part, I do feel like I have gotten more compact by feeling and visual, my stretchmarks having become more visible as if they've been pulled back, slightly less flab on the stomach, and asking for third parties if there's any difference noted, it is possible this very well might be my imagination making up signs of progress.

I am aware of water retention after starting an exercise regimen, and I do consume a decent amount of salt, but after 5 weeks and after weighing myself in the morning I would have thought my system would have balanced itself out and begin going down, my medical results haven't indicated any reason I medically shouldn't be losing this weight either.

Even considering the times I failed to keep on routine, mistakes I recognise have slowed my progress, I should have worst case only lost 3kg if not 4 - 5, the first milestone I set was going below 120 and not seeing any movement towards that has caused a fair bit of dissapointment.

Is there some sort of sort of precedent for longer-term water retention as a result of starting a sudden exercise regimen after a very long sedentary period, or is there some sort of massive mistake I've made or something else that I need to reevaluate.

1k17xsw,loseit,"NSV, fat loss while strength training and maintaining weight.","Stopped focusing on weight loss when I got to my goal, but have been working on getting stronger without gaining weight. 

I might still want to drop another couple of kg, but so far it's actually working. The mass resistribution is pretty unreal. Stayed the same-ish weight for months now, but have tripled the total weight load of every workout, I can see more of the shape of my bones when I stretch, and when I flex the muscle gain is obvious. Waist and hips are smaller and no more lumpy parts. Arms are bigger again but less visible loose skin. 

My body is so much easier to manage than it used to be. Between neuropathy and having a very low BMR, I really appreciate just being able to move more, engage with my physiotherapy, feel less pain, and eat a wider range of foods. I spend way less time thinking about if I am going to be physically capable of handling the day, or worrying about how much/little I am eating or moving. It's peace of mind.

I weigh nearly exactly the same as I did last year (give or take a kg), but I look and feel so incredibly different. 

Thanks to this community for helping me get to where I am without spiralling. Hopefully I can keep going and get to a point where I am 70kg and much leaner and stronger. ",5,7,1744879020.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k17xsw/nsv_fat_loss_while_strength_training_and/

1k0n4xn,loseit,How to stop overeating at every meal,"Bmi: 19,10 this post is more about overeating than weight loss.

I feel like i can't eat ANYTHING without overeating to a point where i feel really uncomfortable.

It's not even that I'm bingeing on sweets and chocolate.
Yesterday i ate too much fruit, too much soup with chicken, too much salad too many vegetables too much ice cream... 

 Im defining ""too much"" by how the amounts made my stomach feel, not the calories. I guess the food itself is pretty healthy. 

I'm getting enough protein (lots of skyr,eggs,tuna, prawns, beans, oats) and i like vegetables and fruit (broccoli, cucumber, etc and apples berries oranges...). 

It's just that once i start eating i cannot stop for some reason? i feel compelled to continue eating until i physically can't stomach anymore. MOREOVER i absolutely HATE feeling full its a feeling i cant stand and YET it happens every day.

I dont even have a huge appetite I'm full after eating 1/2 pizza. And my eating habits are generally better when I'm eating out or sharing since theres a clear end to the meal. I can  comfortably wait for lunch time eating 1 apple. I drink enough water, i walk a lot (no running or anything really strenuous).

It seems like my mental hunger is much larger than my physical hunger? and its ruining my life i feel miserable every day because my stomach feels soo uncomfortable. Im uncomfortably full for HOURS after each meal.
I genuinely wish i could just throw up to stop the feeling. AND YET!!!!!! i still overeat. 
Once i start eating i can't stop out of my own free will the only thing that's stopping me is the feeling of fullness???????? 

I do also overeat on sweets and chocolate which is a more common problem probably? 
not a real binge but still a loss of control its like my brain is turned off for a while. But the bigger problem is that i can eat ANYTHING without overeating 

I'm at a total loss. what do i do ",1,1,1744817108.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k0n4xn/how_to_stop_overeating_at_every_meal/

1k15ex4,loseit,"My key to avoiding a binge, thanks to my therapist - don‚Äôt pass post-swimming hunger.","I commented this on another post and people seemed to find it helpful, so I thought I‚Äôd make a post explaining it to hopefully help more people!

When I was in therapy for my EDs, my therapist had me set up a hunger cues scale to help me avoid binges. It is from 0-10. (My numbers were off in my comment for anyone who saw it. I was going off memory.) She suggested I not dip below a 3. 

Here is my scale:

‚Äî‚Äî-
 
0 - famished. Feeling very faint. Super hangry. 

1 - what I call ‚Äúwellbutrin‚Äù hungry, because it kills my hunger cues until I‚Äôm absolutely starved. This is where I‚Äôm feeling faint, getting a headache, feeling shaky and nauseous. 

2 - post-swimming hunger. Remember when you were a kid and you felt like you could eat a horse when you got out of the pool, but it wasn‚Äôt, like, unpleasant? That‚Äôs my point of no return. This is my final signal to eat something before I will binge, but I will probably overeat a little. Might describe as ‚Äústarving.‚Äù 

3 - meal hungry. Like you are ready for dinner, but definitely not ‚Äústarving.‚Äù

4 - snacky, ‚ÄúI could eat.‚Äù Not a bad idea to eat something small with protein if a meal is a ways away.

5 - neutral. No hunger or fullness cues whatsoever. 

6 - not quite satisfied from your meal. A light snack would put you right in the sweet spot.

7 - satisfied. Not too full, ate just the right amount.

8 - slightly over full. ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt have had that last slice of pizza.‚Äù A little uncomfortable.

9 - Definitely over full. Very uncomfortable. This is what I consider a binge. Felt out of control eating. 

10 - Painfully full. Completely lost control. Ignored all fullness cues for whatever reason. Feel nauseous and like you can‚Äôt even slouch. 

‚Äî‚Äî-

My ideal range is to not dip below a 3 and not exceed a 7. To AVOID exceeding a 7, I cannot dip below a 3. I‚Äôve had 28 years of evidence that I fully lose control when I get too hungry. 

Anyway, try writing your own 0-10 scale and see if it helps you in your fight against binge eating. This has been INSANELY helpful for me and if I actually pay attention and try to avoid leaving my range, I genuinely do not binge.",1656,49,1744868203.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k15ex4/my_key_to_avoiding_a_binge_thanks_to_my_therapist/

I am really struggling mentally with this, ive been overweight my whole life, before covid i did a  diet with a bariatric doctor and got to like 69kg which has been the lowest and the prettiest i've been in my life, but that diet was extremely restrictive and exhausting plus my mental health was terrible at the time (still is but yeah).

but during covid i reached my highest overweight, i was 115 kg and seeing  the scale today and realizing that im still sO CLOSE TO THAT NUMBER really tore me, ive been better like i know i have reached 87 or so (when i was struggling with money and had nothing to eat) but after i got a job i went back to fluctuating by losing and gaining the same kg as always. 

The processes that include weight loss sound so exhausting to me, like ive done diets and can't keep them, i tried omad and last like 2 days, i started calorie counting but im not consistent with that, and my motivation really doesn't match the fact that my mind is having such a hard time, i really hate this, i hate living in this body and i hate that everything seems to be too much for my motivation to get done.

When i read those tips like get your steps, count your calories i know thats what i should be doing but if it were that easy to just read that and get it done i would have started when i was like 14 lol, im sorry im venting like this but my mental obesity doesn't seem to lift me up and the feeling of losing my best years by being obese is killing me, i started considering bariatric surgery, watching toxic things in tiktok to bully myself, the injections we all know are expensive as hell where i live so even if i wanted to take that road my pocket cant do that and MAAAAN I DONT KNOW IM SO FRUSTRATED, i really curse myself and haven't been able to stop thinking about weight not a single day since im like 8 so WELL!!

1k13a0a,loseit,How does insulin affect weight?,"I‚Äôm struggling to grasp how things work, here‚Äôs my understanding. People say that insulin causes your body to store excess glucose as fat.

Hypothetical stats:
Total daily calorie needs 3000

Diet day 1:
Consumes 3000 calories from high glycemic index foods

Diet day 2:
Consumes 3000 calories of low glycemic index foods



I was reading about insulin and that people with insulin resistance will have higher blood sugar levels as their cells are more resistant to insulin making it harder for the cells to absorb sugar from the blood stream. I‚Äôm assuming this would lead to increased hunger and maybe decreased energy levels while your body replenishes reserves. But I don‚Äôt see how this could cause weight gain unless you eat too much to overcompensate for the high blood sugar. Wouldn‚Äôt the body eventually ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù and your blood sugar would stabilize as your cells absorb the glucose, and you would only gain fat if you had an excess.  Your body will just use the stored glycogen during activity? What am I missing here?

What would be the difference between the two diets besides stable blood sugar versus a spike and crash? Would someone with insulin resistance have a different bmr than a person without, assuming their body compositions were identical?",1,8,1744860399.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k13a0a/how_does_insulin_affect_weight/

Hey there! 22F here and new to this sub (tho I have been lurking posts here forever lol).

I am very desperately looking for ways to lose weight. Saying I have tried everything wouldn‚Äôt be entirely earnest because I will admit myself my efforts tend to fall through VERY quickly - like, before results would even be possible to start showing. 

To save most of the unnecessary details, I struggle with mental health (this impacting my motivation and discipline) and BED (past bulimic, never fully recovered, just ended up unintentionally switching disorders in the long run lol). It‚Äôs been very difficult for me to find and commit to something.

All of this being said - being out of shape and the most overweight I have been in my life has only pushed me further into isolation and depression. I feel ashamed to go out with people, haven‚Äôt had my photo taken in forever, my insecurities about my looks are impacting my relationship, and I never have energy (which has now gotten in the way of keeping my space clean, cooking, doing schoolwork, exercising, etc). I want to do better, I want to change, and mostly I made a goal last year that by my 23rd birthday I would finally feel happier with myself physically. 

I have heard wonders about intermittent fasting helping people not only lose weight and get into better eating habits but I am brand new to it and really want to give it my best shot. So any advice is massively appreciated and any advice coming from anyone who has been in a similar position as me is extra massively appreciated! 

*side note: I am in therapy and on antidepressants! - though I wouldn‚Äôt exactly say they have had much impact on this specific problem of mine lol :-)*

1k11r15,loseit,How am I not overweight but so fat?,"For reference I‚Äôm male, 5‚Äô9 and 160lbs, which is in the normal range of BMI but my body fat percentage is a whopping 25% and i visibly look chubby.

I‚Äôve just started a calorie deficit but I‚Äôm worried that even if I lose weight I‚Äôll just lose what little muscle I have and still maintain my high body fat. 


I don‚Äôt really work out at all. I like to go for long walks and that‚Äôs probably the only reason why I‚Äôm not obese or overweight in BMI terms.  Should I start in the gym? If so what workouts/exercises should I do to burn fat and build muscle.

I want to lose a few kg and also get my fitness/strength levels back up.  I just started using Cronometer to track macros and calories.

I started 1.5 weeks ago, I have had a lighter activity week this week, so more like a 300 calorie deficit, but I still struggled.  Some nights I have woken up in the early hours feeling hungry, my mood has leaned towards the negative, and I have struggled with mental focus, even visual focus. Today I had a headache and neck tension most of the morning, could barely focus at work.  I'm wondering if I've gone too aggressive with the deficit?

1k10nl4,loseit,What is weight loss supposed to feel like?,"So I've been at it for a couple weeks now and I honestly feel like crap most of the time. I've been eating mostly plants and keeping my diet super clean, avoiding all added sugar, but even when I eat the amount my phone tells me to I feel so tired. Ive been getting terrible sleep, feeling exhausted, kind of dizzy at times, slightly confused, and apathetic. I wake up multiple times a night (I've had terrible sleep for a while though). Last night I woke up at 3am aching and it felt like my stomach had been vacuum sealed. I tried to fall back asleep for like an hour but I had this strange feeling in my head and even though I was laying down I felt like I was spinning. The previous day I had eaten around 2300 cal at my phone's suggestion, but eventually I just got up and had a snack so I could get some more sleep.

I'm curious how people determine how much to eat to lose weight without feeling like they are going to pass out? For reference I'm 19f, 5'6, \~158lbs and I have a fairly muscular/athletic build. My job typically has me moving 3000+ pounds a day on average and I usually get around 10,000 steps at work alone. Most of the time I don't even feel that hungry I just feel like lying down. I have a hard time listening to and trusting my body since I get such terrible sleep, but if I don't eat ""enough"" it seems like it gets so much worse. Can I figure this out without seeing a professional?

As someone who has struggled with disordered eating and counting calories for the larger part of my life, and who also hates their job, it can be hard for me to be completely honest with myself sometimes. I'm really trying to get it right this time with patience and discipline but I don't really have the resources to get the information that I feel like I need. I would just like an outsider opinion and any tips or tales of a relevant experience would be highly appreciated. Thank you!!!!!

tldr: trying to lose weight has made me feel completely terrible. What is it supposed to feel like? How do you determine how much you are supposed to be eating?",20,50,1744852052.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k10nl4/what_is_weight_loss_supposed_to_feel_like/

However, I feel so much guilt that I ruined all of my progress and I‚Äôm scared to weigh myself and face reality (I will do it, but waiting until after my period starts because I‚Äôm always heavier before it and I don‚Äôt want to see the vacation + period weight). 

A couple things:
1. Would love to hear how others have gotten back on the wagon after vacation. 
2. The scale fear can be real, especially after extended periods of time without weighing myself. How do people cope?

1k0qty8,loseit,Hey anyone use hat baths for weight loss and fat mobilization?,"Edited with links to the scientific journals supporting that hot baths, saunas, and steam rooms support weight loss, but are not and could never be the main method to lose weight -obviously. üòÄ

Just wondering what different people experience using hot baths as a weight loss or maintains practice?

Below is Perplexity (AI app) answer to my question do hot baths aid in weight loss?

""Hot baths can contribute to weight loss indirectly, but they are not a primary method for significant weight reduction. Soaking in a hot bath can burn calories, approximately 140 calories per hour, similar to a 30-minute walk. However, for substantial weight loss, hot baths are often used by athletes for rapid fluid loss, particularly when combined with dietary restrictions. Additionally, hot baths can aid in post-exercise recovery, improve circulation, and reduce fluid retention, which may support overall weight management efforts. For lasting weight loss, a balanced diet and regular exercise remain essential.""

1k0z45q,loseit,Interpretation of Calorie Loss,"Like many people trying to get fit, I'm tracking my calories in and out, and utilizing both cardio and lifting. I use MyFitness Pal in conjunction with Samsung Health. 

I'm confused on how accurate these figures are or if I'm even interpreting correctly. I've attached screenshots. For context, I'm 6'3 and 245lbs as of my last weighing. Goal weight is 215 as I feel that would be a healthy lean muscle weight. Whether that's true I guess remains to be seen.  

Here is my confusion: 

1) MyFitness Pal notes that my total caloric intake today was 1553, which is accurate I tracked that manually to be sure. Really trying to slim down as you can guess. I did 35 minutes of high intensity stationary biking, that's also accurate as I almost barfed by the end of it, really went hard. My activity from Samsung Health is supposed to be synced as well. The app says the cardio burned 810 calories. I do this every day. 

2) Samsung Health says my total burned calories for the whole day (as of posting it's 7:41pm EST), is 2380. Subtract the 1553 intake, and that's an 827 caloric deficit. Right? That's not reflective in MyFitness Pal but idk if that's just a syncing issue. 

Aside from cardio today I was on my feet for about half the day going to inspections (I'm an adjuster) and the other half driving and walking the dog. How accurate is this and, am I just generally doing it right? I also have Fencing practice 2 days per week and lift 3 days per week. Is this 1553 intake still too high, or are these numbers correctly reflecting the efforts? I appreciate any insight.

1k0xx3r,loseit,When counting calories becomes a source of anxiety,"Hey peeps. I just wanted to air out my struggles with CICO recently in hopes that maybe somebody else has felt the same way. I've been doing CICO for a while now, trying to lean out and see some muscle definition. I think I'm pretty close to my goal, but that goal changes everyday as I never feel quite satisfied with my body. But something that has really been bothering me recently is my anxiety around tracking calories. For some reason I keep having these intrusive thoughts that I ate something but didn't log it or tracked or weighed a food wrong. For instance, I'll keep thinking ""what if I actually weighed my yogurt wrong and didn't realize"" or ""what if I logged the calories wrong on that protein bar"" or ""what if I ate breakfast but forgot to log it"". Or even if I have a meal that seems too filling/voluminous to be as few calories as it is. Like a giant bowl of yogurt and strawberries is delicious yet somehow under 300 cals. It gets so bad that I feel like my mind is playing tricks on me. The anxiety kind of follows me the whole day and even when I try to enjoy eating I'm almost constantly worrying about if I tracked it wrong. Logically I know calorie tracking as a whole is a very estimate-based process, but obviously these thoughts are intrusive and not very logical. It's clear that I have some OCD tendencies, but I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this while doing CICO and how you've overcome it, or if you have at all? I don't want to stop CICO because I know that it's the only way I can be sure to achieve my goals, but I think I just need some support here :)",2,7,1744844040.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k0xx3r/when_counting_calories_becomes_a_source_of_anxiety/

1k0xgbb,loseit,Need help managing my eating habits ‚Äì looking for advice or shared experiences,"Hi all ‚Äì I‚Äôm a 25-year-old male, 175cm, 80kg, and probably around 25‚Äì30% body fat. I‚Äôd like to lose a bit of fat (maybe 2‚Äì4kg), but more importantly, I want to improve my relationship with food.

I‚Äôve lost weight in the past (a few years ago), but now I find myself in a really difficult place mentally when it comes to eating. I‚Äôm constantly thinking about what, when, and how much I eat. It feels obsessive ‚Äì and honestly, exhausting.

**Activity-wise**, I exercise frequently. I cycle 10‚Äì15km a day to commute, and I either go for a run (5‚Äì10km) or do strength training at the gym (upper or lower body) pretty much every day. So I‚Äôm active, and I‚Äôm generally conscious of my nutrition.

I‚Äôve tracked macros before and I‚Äôm aware of the importance of protein. I do best when I track, but I‚Äôm trying to get more protein from natural sources like meat, poultry, and dairy instead of powders. That said, I struggle to hit targets unless I *do* track.

I‚Äôm writing this post out of frustration after what happened today. Here‚Äôs what my food roughly looked like:

* **Breakfast**: Protein porridge with blueberries + a bit of peanut butter, coffee
* **Lunch**: 2 chicken thighs, roast veg, ¬Ω a medium flatbread, apple
* **Snacks throughout the day**:
   * A slice of raisin malt loaf
   * KitKat
   * Carrot sticks + 1 falafel
   * Small hot chocolate (semi-skimmed milk)
   * ¬Ω a salted caramel hot cross bun before my run

I then did a **9k run** after work at a moderate pace/effort. After the run:

* 2 eggs + roasted veg + mushrooms in the leftover flatbread
* Skyr yoghurt with protein powder, blueberries, and some peanut butter

And *then* I kind of spiraled. I had what I‚Äôd call a mini snack-fest ‚Äì random stuff like raw vegetables (I often eat raw carrots and broccoli because they feel ""guilt-free""), some nuts, small bits of cheese. I didn‚Äôt track it all, and I felt out of control, angry, and disappointed in myself.

This happens a lot ‚Äì especially **after dinner** or **after exercise**. I feel like I lose all sense of portion control. I keep snacking in the hopes that something will ‚Äúhit the spot.‚Äù I drink a lot of peppermint tea too, so much that it sometimes wakes me up in the night.

I‚Äôm reaching out because I need help. I feel like food has become my only reward system, and I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm developing or already have some kind of disordered eating. I‚Äôm constantly hungry or thinking about food, and it‚Äôs making life harder than it needs to be.

Has anyone been through something similar?  
How did you manage to:

1. Stop erratic snacking and post-exercise binges?
2. Rebuild a more intuitive, healthy relationship with food?
3. Stop thinking about food 24/7?

Thanks to this sub I found out about TDEE so I entered my stats and it gave me 1750 for maintenance, so I figured I would cut 400ish while also starting to exercise 2x wk (orangetheory) at the same time and I would lose, no problem! Well, no -I have lost 1lb the last 3 months. I have been utterly confused but to some extent I figured I am gaining muscle, RIGHT?... until today. 
Today I found the US Navy fat calculator and it gave me a result of 33%, which is obese. I am in utter shock. I am not even considered overweight using my bmi and I thought I was trying to lose vanity lbs but I now see it is a matter of health. When entering this addl number in the TDEE my maintenance calories drop to 1550, which just made me realize it is essentially impossible for me to lose weight without significantly increasing my exercise level, which seems contrary to what many people in this sub say. 

Realizing that the reason I could eat ""normally"" years ago, and remain 130lbs was because I was spending HOURS exercizing is such a revelation.

Ever since I have become consistent, I have actually seen changes in my body (my clothes fit much better!) and progress in the gym (I have been able to do a progressive overload).
Since I did not focus on diet all this while, my weight hasn‚Äôt budged and has only seen a 1-2 kg difference in this time period.
I thought I was undergoing body recomposition and hence my weight did not change much, but really expected to see a positive trend in the muscle mass vs. body fat percentage ratio. However, my body fat % has been around 38-40% as per the Boditrax machine in my gym. 

Is the machine inaccurate or have I actually not lost any body fat?",1,10,1744836605.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k0v343/no_drop_in_body_fat_percentage/

Just wanted to come on here and talk to the girlies to say that I‚Äôve learned a LOT lately about the differences for women when it comes to physical health and wellness and specifically a few ways that make a huge difference for us in weight loss/strength gains. 

Anyone who‚Äôs interested definitely check out Stacy Sims‚Äô research on the subject, but the TLDR; of it is that I‚Äôve tried some of these things and they‚Äôve made a huge different for me. Specifically:

1. Eating at least 15g of protein within half an hour of waking up. It was SO hard for me to start this habit but it‚Äôs made an enormous difference in my energy, mood, and weight loss. 

2. Lifting heavy 1-2x per week. 

3. Short bursts of going as hard as I can (running, specifically) with short rests, 3x. It makes the body increase capability because you show it what the current limit is. The body will adjust based on the physical stressors it‚Äôs given. Side note though I worked up to this. I‚Äôve lost 40lbs so far and it wasn‚Äôt until the last few weeks where I‚Äôve started to be able to do this. 

4. SO much water 

5. 20-30 minutes of cooldown yoga after cardio and weights. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs all! Check out her research and keep your body in mind - not everything that works for men works for us, ESPECIALLY fasting. Research how the female body works if you have one and notice where the research lacks. You‚Äôll probably be as shocked and mad as I am when you see how little the research actually represents us and how our bodies function differently than men.

1k0thpy,loseit,The journey starts again,"Been lurking for a couple of weeks now and I've finally decided to buckle down and get back to working on myself. 

I (44M, 5'11) have been on this path before. Back in my 20s I got up to 330lbs. After I hit 30 something finally clicked in my head and I started religiously tracking calories and exercising. After a couple years, I had myself down to 155lbs, the best shape I've ever been in my life. 

I didn't actually find the losing process difficult at all, my mind was just in the right place to stick with it. Life was great, I finally felt comfortable enough to do things I always wanted to. International travel, hiking up mountains, and not feeling self conscious just existing outside. 

Early 2023, my wife was diagnosed with cancer and my focus completely changed. I stopped thinking about what I was eating, it just wasn't important to me. She passed away the beginning of 2024. After that I spiraled and just didn't care. I'd ballooned back up to 265lbs. 

I'm finally feeling clear again though. I've been back into my tracking habit for the past two weeks, lost 5 lbs and don't feel like I'm starving at all. I hope I can continue on with the same ease I did the last time. 

She wouldn't have wanted me to isolate and be alone forever. But before I can even think about dating again, I need to get my body back to where I'm confident and feel like a partner wouldn't be embarrassed to be seen next to me. By this time next year, I'm hoping I'll be where I need to be.

I decided at the beginning of this process to take progress pictures and measurements every 10 pounds lost. (Waited for 15 pounds lost for the first follow up since my starting weight was a multiple of 5 and I wanted every following check in to be multiples of 10s; tell me you have OCD without telling me)

This week I've been consistently weighing in around that 15 pound mark, so I went ahead and took my first progress pictures and measurements since starting. I felt awful about how I looked in the photos... but then I compared them to the ones I took when I started. And then I took measurements and saw that I lost 3"" on my waist and 1"" on my thighs.

Having this concrete proof that my body IS in fact changing even if I can't see it when I look in the mirror is so reaffirming. It helps me be like ""Look! I stuck with it and it's working!!"" It's makes me feel like the work I've put in hasn't been for nothing. Even though I have a lot more to go, I feel good with my progress and this gave me a boost.

The scale isn't the end all be all. Progress can be measured in everything from measurements, visual perception, the way clothes fit, how good you feel, how much easier it is for you to navigate the world in your body, and more.

Hi guys, using my second account because I‚Äôm worried friends will find this from my main account lolll

I have been heavier my entire life, save for the pandemic when my mental health spiraled being home all the time and I decided to do keto and IF (not at all in a healthy way) dropping from 280 to 195 before gaining all that weight back (and more) once I went back to school in-person. It wasn‚Äôt sustainable at all, and so I‚Äôm trying out a different path to my goal this time.

Now, I‚Äôm about the heaviest I‚Äôve been at around 302 pounds, and I started this weight loss journey three weeks ago at 305. However, I weighed myself this morning since yesterday marked three weeks since I began, and I just felt completely defeated to see the number has barely moved.

Idk if I‚Äôm doing something wrong. I‚Äôve mostly been focusing on CICO and water intake, and I feel I‚Äôve been doing alright with it. I try to stay around 1600-1700 calories a day, maybe a little more on days where I exercise for longer periods of time. I usually end the day anywhere with a deficit of 800-1200 calories depending on how much I exercise, with my weekly exercise increasing in the past week now that I have a gym membership. The only exceptions to my deficit are two days in the past few weeks where I allowed myself a cheat meal, but I still stayed below my BMR even on those days.

I just feel so stuck, and seeing the numbers on the scale barely move just sucks all the motivation right out of me. I keep looking back at pictures of myself when I was at my lowest and try to use that as a motivator to work on myself, but it‚Äôs just SO hard.

Idk what I‚Äôm doing wrong, but I just needed to vent. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Scrolling through this community is what has kept me on this path even 3 weeks in ‚ù§Ô∏è",4,3,1744828965.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k0s0ec/struggling_to_stay_motivated/

1k0nk16,loseit,Does having breakfast help you? Also some thoughts on fasting,"I've been trying to lose weight for a while, mainly through intermittent fasting. I would usually start fasting around 8pm, skip breakfast, and have my first meal (lunch) around noon, so 16 hours total.

The problem is I work on weekdays and I end up really hungry and irritable while working around 10:30. By the time lunch comes around I gulf my lunch down and possibly overeat. 

Almost two weeks ago I started eating breakfast. Oatmeal with fruit (either blackberries or raspberries) and one scoop of vanilla protein powder. I feel like this has helped balance me a lot and I find I am eating less during lunch and dinner, which has been helpful. Intermittent fasting can definitely help but I found for me that I would end up overeating during my ""eating windows"" which seemed to negate the time I was fasting.

1k0mk4t,loseit,Weight loss (slow or stopped progress),"Hello to all members of group!

I started going to the gym at the beginning of March. Since then, I've been trying to maintain a healthy diet.
However, for more than a month now, I've been struggling to stick to my diet routine. Despite that, I'm still losing weight overall.

When I first started, I was around 106 kg (233 pounds).
My weight keeps fluctuating because I occasionally break my diet routine.
The lowest I've been was 100.5 kg (221.58 pounds), but today I‚Äôm at 103 kg (about 6 pounds heavier).

I'm doing my best to control my calorie intake, but sometimes the feeling of hunger becomes too strong, and I end up eating whatever I crave.
I have a personal trainer who guides me on how to train and what to eat or avoid, but the constant hunger is hard to manage.
Sometimes I try to suppress it by drinking water or eating fruits.
Gym trainer advised to me to drink protein but I didn't buy for now

I know I could have lost more than 5 kg by now, but something isn‚Äôt going right‚Äîprobably with both my workouts and of course with my diet.
What advice can you give me to completely change my diet routine?
What should I do when I feel hungry?
Should I start doing extra workouts every day? (Currently, I go to the gym 3 times a week.)",2,3,1744815660.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k0mk4t/weight_loss_slow_or_stopped_progress/

I‚Äôm female, 5‚Äô6‚Äù, 32‚Äù waist, and weigh 178 lbs.

Can anyone explain how this can be? I‚Äôm just trying to get an idea of what weight is best for me to try to reasonably maintain. Right now I‚Äôm thinking 160-165, which is obviously still in the overweight range but I was happiest at this weight in the past.  This is more for health reasons for me as I am already pretty okay with how I look.

Back in February of 2024, I went to the doctor and got weighed and was surprised at how much I weighed, I thought I was maybe 340-ish pounds, but I turned out to be 409 pounds. I did not look anything like it, went completely ignored and so we started a program where I was on phentermine for a month to see how it would go and I lost a good amount of weight within the first month. I then asked to be taken off the phentermine as I had to also stop my drinking, because I was drinking alcohol pretty heavily on top of eating what I was eating. I've had a pretty consistent time of losing weight, didn't really run into any stagnation, some months slower than others but it was always a downward trend. I did request to go back on phentermine in January of 2025 as at that point I have not touched alcohol since at least August of 2024 and also to help with the hunger now. Middle of March up until today, I have been stagnant in my weight loss. I am constantly going between 282-286 and not any below at all. My daily calorie intake is 2200-2500, with me trying to eat a lot more protein where I usually sit around 150-170g of protein a day. I do hit the gym 3 or 4 times a week, usually walking on the treadmill at a 3.9 speed for about 45 minutes and then I'll do some upper body muscle training, but nothing too drastic. On the days I don't go to the gym, I still get between 3-4k steps in. 

Am I doing something wrong at this point, such as I need to focus more on cardio or cut my calories back further? Or is this just stagnation due to the amount go weight lost? My end goal is 220-230 pounds as I can already see I'm going to need loose skin removal surgery and I'm just going to assume I'm siting on close to 15-20 pounds of loose skin once I get to my goal and then I do want to start truly toning my muscles after the recovery period from that, where I'm good with being around 210-220 for my total weight.

1k0krzl,loseit,I don't have a goal weight. When did you...,"This is going to sound like a stupid question. But I'm sure I'm not the only person who has been here. I'm sure the answer to all these questions is going to be ""whatever works for you"" but it's motivating to hear other people's experience. 

I'm 160cm (5'3""). I was 75kg and I'm down to 63kg since December. Currently eating 1700 a day. I'm still losing weight but I'm not really sure what my TDEE is (SAHP, two very active outdoorsy children, extended breastfeeding ETC). I'm still losing weight (0.8kg a week average over 3.5 months). I don't have any time to do deliberate exercise at the moment because my 1.5yo doesn't believe in sleep or a moral basis and my 3yo is just very 3. No childcare really to palm them off. 

When did you know to stop? I think if I kept eating 1700 I'd eventually be underweight. But I've already blown past my first two goals (65kg and 63.8kg got me into healthy BMI). If I had to guess a goal weight I'd say 60kg but it would just be an arbitrary choice. I might feel even better at 58kg or 56.7kg or whatever. 

When did you know to buy new clothes? I decided to start taking care of myself in January and I didn't really expect the weight loss to work, so I also treated myself to a few new clothes to make myself feel better. I found the perfect jeans but now they're too big and were immediately discontinued. I'm not sure about going on a hunt for something new. On one hand, I don't know if I'm going to lose more. On the other hand, I've only been doing this 3.5 months. How do I know I'm not just going to put it all back on? It happens to people all the time. My instinct was to wait until these jeans wear out but they're pretty good quality and that could be years. 

How did you know when to stop counting calories? I'm not keen on the idea of doing it forever, but I feel like eating at maintenance without tracking and eating at deficit with a record are very different skills. I've been trying the occasional day without recording it and I can tell that I'm more inclined to ""treat yoself"". I'm open to the idea of maintenance involving tracking for nutrition maybe 5 days a week long term, and maybe that's for the best.

I've boxed, powerlifted, marathoned, everything but swim. Last year I let myself go diet wise due to drama in my personal life and got up to 250 lbs. I decided to lock in and did loose some 20 lbs in the span of 5-6 months. But since then I have stagnated and cannot loose one more pound. I always made sure that I keep myself in a calorie restriction (around 1900 calories) and eat whole foods and fruit, (veggies are frozen.) I am doing what all the resources say and I cannot loose weight.
I even consulted my doctor to get labs done and he didn't find anything and was more confused than I was. 
Has this happened ever to anyone? And if so what did you do to overcome it? I know I can reach my goal weight I did it last year. 
Any tips would be appreciated.

A quick context of what's going on:

In November I weighed 117 kilograms (\~257lbs), with a height of 181 cm (5'11""). I've been in a caloric deficit since then, eating about 2200 kcal from November to March, where I calculated that my TDEE is about 2700-2800 kcal per day.  
The weight was already dropping more slowly in February, until finally in March after another two weeks of activity and deficit it didn't drop at all so Since March I jumped to 1900 calories and... the weight stopped dropping completely. On March 4 I weighed exactly 104.45kg, I switched to 1900kcal, today is April 16 and I weigh.... 104.5kg.  
Totally don't know what to do, it enters my head strongly because I fought depression for years, so I attach terrible importance to it. I don't know what I should do anymore. I've been doing strength training (upper/lower) 4 times a week since November (and 3 rest days), doing cardio five times a week.

Hunger is my body asking for energy.
But here's the catch:
My body already HAS energy‚Äîstored as FAT.
When I'm not entertaining all signs of hunger, my body will turn to those fat stores for fuel.
This is EXACTLY what I want.

Dinner is in three hours. I won't starve till then.
So here I am downing a glass of water and sticking to my deficit.

I'm back, at least trying, to lose what I've gained over the past 1.5 years.

M34, probably 115kg at 175cm. Haven't weighed in yet, scared af.

Quick recap: was really fit, got into a relationship, got super comfy again, now that the relationship is over I need to get back on track.

And it's always been like that for me, apparently I can't understand that I should be healthy for myself, not good looking for women.

Thing is now, I can't stop overeating. I just can't. I picked up weight lifting again, I love it and I don't have to force myself. I also already activated muscle memory and my strength is amazing, but everything is covered in a thick layer of fat.

My question: how do I force myself to eat less without immediately going to a therapist? What are some tricks I can use on my brain?

I'm super grateful for any clues at this point, thank you.",1,2,1744795366.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k0g5r7/back_again/

1k0affi,loseit,"Close to goal, conflicted about where to go","My weight has fluctuated a lot in my life, with The highest being 95kg and the lowesr being 51kg. I am 166cm tall.

The first time I had lost a lot of weight (I was down from 85kg at the age of 16 and a half to 51kg at the age of 18) I started to get a bit body dismorphic, partly because I has assumed that being skinny would mean having a flat stomach, but also because I am naturally kind of a pair shape so after a certain amount of weight loss, I dresses would start to be loose around my chest while simultaneously being tight around my hips and thighs.

Gained a bubch of weight around 24 and was 95kg within a year.

Between then and now, I have gone through periods of intentional weight loss to about 10kg, followed by years at a time of maintainig that loss, so I am thankful that I have not yo-yo'd. 

I choose high protein and fibre foods, but  my brain just freaks out if I am in too much of a deficit. My thyroid is apparently normal when I got this checked. But even though I have been lucky to maintain the loss I have had, the closer I get, the more difficult further weight loss is.

I am currently 32.

I had 62kg in my head as a goal. I know most people fluctuate and recently I have been eating fairly low carb as I just function better that way. But I have gradually been adding more carbogydrates back in, as I know that some of my weight loss is water weight. 

65-66kg is where I am sitting on a moderate amount of carbogydrates and afrer gradually weining off GLP-1 medication this time around.

I have been doing some strength training at the gym but have limited time. My job is quite active as I woen in bush regeneration.

But the closer I am to my goal, the harder it is.

I am conflicted about whether I want to:

1. Lose a few more kilograms
2.  Start increasing my intake towards maintnance and focus on core training/body recomp/toning
3. Be happy with the fact that I feel healthier and stronger

When I was 28 I was having back issues and sciatica. Switching to a more active job and then losing some weight aleviates it a lot (I had to try hard to lose weight still because for me when I increase my activity level my hunger increases accordingly, so I am not someone who could just start a more active job and organically/effortlessly lose weight).

But I still have a weak core. So strengthening that a bit might be good for functional and aesthetic reasons.

But I am balancing full-time work with part-time study and I don't want to set goals that will be a nightmare to maintain.

Just wondering if any other people are in a similar boat getting to or close to their goal and trying to make decisions about to what extent you want to keep going.

1k0bx9a,loseit,Am I nuking my metabolism?,"


Edit: oksy thanks for yelling at me. I guess i thought so few calories would be fine on me becsuse years ago i had a conversation with a dude who was big into nutrition and said i could eat way less cause I have epilepsy and going into ketosis would be helpful. Anyways. Im an idiot and am going to go eat a banana.

So back in March I had a very abrupt realization that I had put on quite a bit of weight. I weighed myself while visiting family and was 230 pounds. I realized I needed to make some changes.

I know a big part is my lack of activity. Calories in calories out. I decided to cut calories as much as possible. I only eat dinner (coffee and water durring the day) and maybe a snack. Most days I total around 300-500 calories. 

Obviously I know I can't stay on this calorie limit forever. The plan is to get to under 200, then continue with more calories at a slower rate. I'm at 207 last weigh in. So should only be a few more weeks.

Thing is I'm getting conflicting info if doing this means my metabolism will be shot. Lots of people say starvation mode is a myth. It's all down to calories in calories out. But I'm still seeing some that are basically implying ill need to eat this amount for the rest of my life if I want to get to a healthy weight.

To sum it up, my partner was slightly overweight when we started dating, but gained more over the first six months of our relationship. They have symptoms of a binge eating disorder that was contributing to the weight gain. While I expressed concerns about the binging, I never commented negatively on the weight gain. 

Two months ago, they went on a crash diet and cut calories from likely 3000+/day to 1000. They have lost 30+ lbs in two months. I am supportive of the decision to lose weight but when it seems natural, I express concern about the pace.

I don‚Äôt like how they got there, but I have to admit they look amazing. I was already very attracted to them and at this point I can hardly look directly at them. 

Here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. My partner has been fishing for compliments, and I have been dodging left and right. I‚Äôll say they look great but I haven‚Äôt admitted that I‚Äôm personally finding them more attractive now.  There are signs of disordered eating and I worry that I will cause lasting harm if I say the wrong thing. They could also easily gain that weight back and I want them to feel secure with me if that happens.

1k0ag9g,loseit,My body comp has changed yet weight is the same on 500 cal deficit? Im only really stretching so i dont think its muscle gain.,"So 2 years ago i went on a very unhealthy ""weightloss journey"" where although i did eat ""healthy"" and excercised, I didnt eat nearly enough and eventually health complications forced me to stop. I had lost 15kg and was the skinniest ive ever been at bmi 20, though i was also at my weakest. The next year i went through some pretty extreme stress and put back 10kg. The start of this year i realised i was putting back on the weight but starving myself just wasnt an option thanks to the health complications so i had to lose it at a much more steady pace, though i will admit i havent been super responsible, but im still on a 500 cal deficit everyday. The main lifestyle changes i have been making are just moving around a bit more, stretching (so i can touch my toes) and trying to get as close to 5 serves of veg a day (though i only really achieve 2-4 on most days). Thankfully, this has seen major improvements visually and flexibility wise and my measurements and body fat are nearly the same as they were when i was maybe 5kg lighter though i definitely look more lean, though its hard to say as i was very body dysmorphic at the time and can hardly remember much. The thing is, my weight has barely changed at all. I lost maybe 1-2kg and thats it. Its not unsuprising given my habits arent the healthiest, but the change in body comp really confuses me. I refuse to believe its muscle as im about as strong as i was when i was higher in fat, only more flexible and im doing hardly any more excercise other than stretching, but my body comp has really changed quite drastically for so little weight change.

My goal weight for a while has been 152 just so I can say I lost 100 pounds because that's nicer than 95.

In that spurt since October, I have tracked my calories in and out to make sure I'm in a big enough deficit to reach my goal. My tracking obviously isn't perfect but I try to be reasonably close. 

Let's look at my numbers. All weights are weekly rolling averages of daily measurements, which themselves are averages of two morning and nighttime measurements. Calories in comes from my own daily tracking, averaged and rounded to the nearest 10. Calories out comes from my Fitbit, again averaged and rounded. Expected change is how many pounds I would expect to lose that month if my tracking was 100% accurate. And the difference is just the difference between that expected value and how much my weight actually changed, along with what percentage of the expected change that difference was‚Äîbasically, how off my tracking was.

##October '24

I started tracking on October 7, so this month only includes 25 days of data.

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
185.9 | 176.4 | -9.5 | 1380 | 2890 | -1510 | -10.8 | -1.5 (14%)

So, if my tracking was completely accurate, I'd expect to have lost 10.8 pounds but I only lost 9.5. But my tracking obviously isn't completely accurate, so some difference makes sense. No issues here; I was very happy with my progress this month.

##November '24


Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
176.4 | 169.9 | -6.5 | 1360 | 2740 | -1380 | -11.8 | -5.3 (45%)

This month, I still dropped in weight, but now I was pretty sure there was some systematic issue in my tracking causing my actual loss to lag significantly behind the expected, as my expected loss was near double the actual.

##December '24

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
169.9 | 162.6 | -7.3 | 1560 | 2800 | -1240 | -11.0 | -3.7 (34%)

Higher average intake this month but kept my loss steady, and the expected loss was closer to the actual too.

##January '25

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
162.6 | 158.9 | -3.7 | 1350 | 2290 | -940 | -8.3 | -4.6 (55%)

My loss slowed this month, which was no surprise to me as I was much less physically active. From October to December, I consistently biked about 3 hours a week (usually 1.5 hours each weekend day), but by late December it was too cold to bike and then in January, my gym closed for renovations. I kept my intake low to compensate (very low in fact, for a couple of weeks I kept it around 1000-1200 which was miserable and I soon raised it to 1400-1500). Here, I realized something was seriously wrong with my tracking as my actual loss was less than half the expected, even though I'd say I was arguably stricter at counting this month than before.

##February '25 

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
158.9 | 157.1 | -1.8 | 1510 | 2290 | -740 | -5.9 | -4.1 (69%)

Didn't go outside often this month since much of it was miserably cold, so like January, I exercised very little. I kept my deficit steady but was very disappointed in my actual loss still lagging far behind the expected, especially since I was so close to my goal weight. Around mid to late February, I switched to generally having one large meal a day making up ~80% of my calories as doing so kept me significantly less hungry throughout the day than if I ate several smaller meals.

##March '25

Start | End | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
157.1 | 155.7 | -1.4 | 1400 | 2300 | -900 | -7.9 | -6.5 (82%)

My weekly average seesawed between 155 and 158 throughout the month, which was surprising as before, it pretty much was a straight downward trend since October and I was still in (what should have been) a good-sized deficit. I generally kept with my one large meal a day program from February.

##April '25 

So far, of course.

Start | Now | Change | Cals In | Cals Out | Deficit | Exp. Change | Diff
---|---|----|----|----|----|----|----
155.7 | 156.2 | 0.5 | 1430 | 2480 | -1050 | -4.2 | -4.7 (112%)

I've gained so far this month, but I've also changed the most from previous months. First, I've started going to the gym again, though for lifting, not cardio. I was aiming to start building muscle and improving my physique once I reached my goal weight, but with that taking longer than I expected, I went ahead with it now to not have it be too long without doing much physical activity. I've remained in my deficit, hoping that the extra calories I burn from going to the gym will finally push me toward 152, and again I've generally been having one large meal a day. The difference is that now I am making sure to hit about 120-130 g of protein. I wasn't counting protein before this month but I'd guess before April, I wasn't averaging more than 60-70. But I am still in a deficit that should have me losing weight week over week. I'm guessing my stagnation here is something about the body's response to the activity/diet changes? But that isn't the point of the post.

#Tracking 

What *is* the point is, across these months, my ""deficit"" as tracked is 1100 calories per day. Across 190 days, I should be down around 60.2 pounds (which would make me massively underweight). But I have lost just 29.7 pounds. My tracking is off by about 0.16 pounds a day, which is a whole 560 calories. That's like if I was drinking an extra milkshake each day for the last six months without ever logging it. I am completely fine with my tracking being a little off as there's no way for it to be perfect. But that much for that long? I really don't know at this point.

For calories in, I was a little looser to start with but was still making sure anything I ate was accounted for. I eat out pretty frequently and try to avoid places that don't post their calorie counts, and if I do eat at one, I try to use an upper-end calorie estimate. And recently, if I'm able to bring something home, I started weighing the portion and comparing it to the official"" portion size to get a more accurate count. And when I cook at home (which I started doing more in January), I weigh all my ingredients if I'm not using something packaged that clearly states the amount. I do frequently use zero calorie sweeteners, but since they aren't really zero, just below 5 so they can legally be reported as zero, I recently started counting things like Splenda packets or squirts from Mio bottles as 5 each just to be safe. I recently started counting black/instant coffee and diet soda as 5 or 10 each as well. I count little things like multivitamins, sauces, etc. to the best of my ability. 

And for calories out, I use my Fitbit. I'm sure the Fitbit isn't perfect but it's better than nothing. I've also been adjusting my weight on it so it factors a lower BMR into however it calculates burn. We could assume a certain portion of my calories burned above my BMR are systematically inflated by its tracking. For such purposes, let's take just March and April since my weight change has been small in these months. According to my recorded deficit, I should've lost 12.1 pounds since March 1, but I have only lost 0.9, so in this month and a half, my tracking is somehow off by 870 calories a day. My BMR at 155 lbs is about 1700 (I've hovered around 154-158 in this span and the BMR difference is negligible) and my calories burned in this span is 2350. So if I was in a coma since March 1 while somehow ""recording"" the same amount of calories out and receiving the same amount of calories in, I (well, my doctors) would still have to be overcounting those calories in by 220 each day to account for the discrepancy. I haven't been in a coma. I did some searches on metabolism to see if I could just have a slow metabolism but saw the general consensus among commenters was that metabolism is generally just a buzzword people use to explain not losing as much weight as they should and CICO is all that matters. So I dunno. Can BMR vary significantly between people of the same height/weight/sex/age? (i.e. is it possible my BMR might be much less than 1700?)

I know I'm already at a good weight, but like I said, I just want to drop those last 2-3 pounds to get to that sweet 100 lbs lost‚Äîwhich I should've reached months ago if my tracking wasn't so wrong. Being so close and doing the right things while having my progress significantly slow down recently has been very frustrating. I'm patient and very willing to stay the course. But I still want to figure out how my tracking could be so off for so long, especially if I'm going to start focusing on building muscle and getting into bulk/cut cycles.",2,7,1744768589.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k096ty/whats_wrong_with_my_tracking_recently/

As the title says I need help inderstanding TDEE I keep seeing conflicting opinions on the sub about TDEE to put exercise as sedentary and others say to put in your actually activity level. So which is true?

I weight train 3 times a week i would consider them intenses workouts because my BPM never goes below 120 for the full 80 minutes I workout.

 I also go for walks on the weekend there low intensity but i got about 6k steps for the 1 hour I walk I also got around 6 to 8k steps a day.

Im currently on a deficit of 1800 calories a day but my weight in fluctuating like crazy because of water weight I drink about 3 to 4 litres of water a day. My weight is going down just a lot slower then I would have thought going off of the TDEE i should  be losing close to 2kg a week but seems more like 1kg a week 

Now I weight everything I eat going of the packaging I a mean weight everything. Oils, Condiments etc so im hitting 1800 pretty consistently 

So my question is should I listen to the  TDEE calculation and up my calories or should I keep them the same? Would love to hear your opinion thanks for reading ",2,4,1744763527.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1k07k53/need_help_understanding_tdee/

That 277lbs was back in late January, when my doctor put me on Wegovy. It's gone well and I'm on a low dose of the medicine (0.5mg), but I'm not holding to my goals very well.

I'm back in college after life forced me on a hiatus some years ago and I really want to be done with weight loss before next term. Dealing with being stressed about my weight, side effects of my meds, and school, plus life in general has been a little rough.

I'm using an app called MacroFactor to track everything, and it currently estimates I'll be at my goal weight (215lbs) by mid-August. But, that's slipped from where it started, which was late-July.

I've definitely gone over my calories in that time, maybe an average of once a week, but never to as high as maintenance. I'm just feeling very discouraged and like I should be working harder. Those days of over eating were usually date nights, or days when I was just really craving something.

Currently, I eat about 1800cal daily with 170g of protein also daily. I do a fairly intense 30-60 minute boxing class every Monday, and do a 60-90 minute gym session of mostly lifting, followed by some cardio 4 days a week. I don't know how to push harder, but I feel like I have to.

I am 5‚Äô6, 26(F) who recently went from 165 in August to now weighing 125. I still have some stomach fat / back fat that I would like to slim down, so I had gave myself a rough goal of 120lbs. 

I am a very active person - I typically lift weights for an hour and do low intensity cardio for an hour every single morning. I am also training for a half marathon so some days are more cardio focused than weights. I average about 12K-15K steps a day (including my runs of course). 

I eat about 100-120g of protein a day, mostly whole foods other than things like sauces, cheese, deli meats, etc. 

Anyway, I was doing well losing 1-1.5lbs a week but have been stuck at 125lbs since about mid March (so a month ish). I‚Äôve been eating on average 1200-1500 calories depending on my training day (more around my long runs, less the other days). 

Anyone have any tips for breaking through the last 5? do we think i should just kinda end/lessen my deficit and focus on more of a recomp style? 

for reference, according to my apple watch and now garmin, I burn about 2100-2400 calories a day (much more on long run days). I know that makes my deficit appear steep but i also avoid tracking things like veggies, light sauces, lettuce, oils, etc to avoid going crazy haha

I have been in a constant on/off calorie deficit for the past year. I started at 64kg and am at 61kg now, which isn't a lot considering I have been constantly thinking about my weight and dieting the past year in a deficit.

I started with a gym bro who told me I needed to eat 275g protein a day (!!!) and was eating 1700 calories. 

I then stopped with him and went back to what I was eating before (around 2000 cals). 

Then I started with a new PT who put me on keto at 1395 cals (130g protein, 50g less carbs, 75g fat) without me easing into it. 

Is it true that after being on 1395 cals (I am tired and miserable), when I have a weightloss plateau my body will be used to such low calories that I'll have to keep dropping even lower in order to lose weight?

I went on holiday and was on maintenance (probably more) and then dropped to 1500 again. I'm thinking when I'm away again in a few weeks should I do maintenance and then when I come back go to 1800 for a few weeks, then to 1650) to give my body a strategic reset?

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I started the year at 328lbs and I don't remember the last time I didn't see the 3 up there. I started counting my calories in February and today I am at 301lbs! I am 2lbs away but I don't feel good about it. I am happy with the progress I made, but I am still unhappy in my body.

I have set my calories just above 2,200 per day, and it works for me. I get hungry from time to time, but I wouldn't say that it's too hard for me. The hardest part for me is when I put on clothes or when I see myself in the mirror. Every time I put on pants, I see the a small bulge spill over the top and it makes me want to put on a shirt over it quickly to hide it. The mirror is the worst one. I can see my stomach hasn't shrunk from the front, but I can see the sides have sunk in a bit. My body makes me uncomfortable and I wish I didn't have it, but I'm stuck with it. And I know that it will take time for me to reach an ideal weight, but at this point I wonder if I will ever love my body. 

  
Sorry for the vent, I wanted to make a celebratory post.

For context, my mom is overweight and has been her whole life and my dad is but not as big as my mom. I currently went from 170lbs from when my depression hit badly and i used to be 130lbs.  I struggled for years to motivate myself to lose it. I would have periods where i workout and lose weight then to giving up when dont see the progress I want.

I have been taking it more seriously now for 1-2 months  and i went from 170lbs to now sitting at 151lbs.

My parents tend to make jokes mostly my mom. She has always made comments here and there like "" ur shirts look tight"" "" u look like ur gaining weight"". Today i told her ""my arms look like im getting muscle huh?"" and she responded with "" no but i can see ur muffin top hanging over ur shirt"" I then told her "" i am not commenting about yours"". 

This frustrated me and i know i shouldnt have gave her the same energy back but it like at least im trying! I hate when people have something to say especially when they are overweight themselves and barely try to lose weight. I feel emotional typing this because your family is supposed to love you and hearing it from them can really hurt. Sometimes i think shes right what if i am not really making progress.

Life happened, gained it all back slowly and surely in 2021 weighed like 318 I think. Got down to 260 last year and went back up to 275 currently.

I'm struggling so hard I looked for copium and found where it said an outrageously high percent of people who lose a lot of weight gain it back, even more sometimes. The number it gave was 90%. If not I know the number is high still.

I had gained it back because when COVID happened I was weight training hard as hell(bench, squat, deadlift 225, 10 chinsups/pulls in a single set) with poor recovery and that turned into casual weight training with zero cardio even eventually.

I'm trying to find a positive in this. Like that even though I messed up and gained in back in the past 10 years I've been 10x more active than when I was a kid up until 17. Something, anything.

Another hard thing is my limitations. I just wanna be low weight again and have really high numbers with running, stationary bike, chin ups, pull ups 

I can run, consistently through the years. I can ride the stationary bike consistently as well. And I have worked my way up to chin ups pull ups and dips again though. As well all the barbell exercises and dieting better. Lately been slacking on the diet but over the years I do try and eat more vegetables, whole wheat bread, less fast food, virtually no sodas unless I'm going weak on dieting rarely.

This is my first post but I just wanted to share a little victory. I‚Äôve always had a weird relationship with food and my body. I was an athlete growing up and have always had a big appetite. When I was 21, I randomly started gaining some weight and this has steadily increased. I didn‚Äôt weigh myself often but I think I was around 160-170 in college.

When I realized this past year that I had gained probably 60+ lbs and gone from a size 6/8 to size 16 and I realized I needed a change. I attributed the weight gain to possible medication side effects or other health issues. After getting my blood checked and stopping the medication I was taking, I realized those were not the cause. I thought maybe something was ‚Äúwrong‚Äù with me and I would just keep gaining weight. 

So at the start of 2025, I decided to start a calorie deficit and begin strength training and walking more. My diet has been up and down, as I‚Äôm not extremely strict, especially on the weekends. I will let myself enjoy a meal out or not track calories for a couple days. Then I reset and go back to my deficit. I think this is the only way I‚Äôve been able to sustain the deficit. In the past, I would be very restrictive and not allow myself to overeat ever or eat any unhealthy foods, which is not sustainable for me. Sure, I could probably be losing more if I was more strict, but I know I wouldn‚Äôt last and would fall back into old habits.

I think I‚Äôve reached the point where it feels like my lifestyle has changed and it feels so good. Even when I do eat something unhealthy, I find myself not needing to overindulge or ordering a smaller size naturally. It feels really good. Now I‚Äôm just hoping I start noticing more of a physical difference and get some non-scale victories!

1jzz22f,loseit,It's easier to for me to be in an unhealthy deficit than a healthy deficit,I (22M) have been trying to lose weight since I was 16. I've lost most of the weight by being in an unhealthily low deficit. Like eating only 500 calories a day. I don't feel good when I do this. I'm weak all day and I know it's not good for me. But I've tried so many times to eat at a 500 calorie deficit and for some reason I always end up binge eating by the end of the day. It's almost like eating more makes me want food more. I'm not sure if it's more unhealthy to binge eat or to eat 500 calories a day. I'm at a bit of a hard situation right now. Just wanted to rant about it a bit. Thanks for reading.

1jzy997,loseit,Is there a venting group?,"I really don't want to tell my whole life story, but the tl;dr is that I successfully lost a decent amount of weight when I was in high school 10000 years ago, my family didn't approve, and I've since put on all the weight and then some. I want to go back. I don't need help/advice; I've seen the results and know exactly what I need to do to get there.

My big problem though is that I want to lurk in a realist community. I truly love the positive, supportive energy I see here, but that doesn't do it for me. I've had so many people be nice to me and say things like ""Good job on staying on your deficit! It's tough now, but it gets easier! You went over your calories? Don't give up! Try again tomorrow!"" It's good general advice, but I don't think it's entirely for me. I want to be around other people who see this journey as a burden, as blatantly miserable and too much work, but know it's worth the struggle. I want to complain about feeling hungry and see that dozens of other heavy people are also hungry and we can all be miserable together knowing it's for our own good. I don't want advice, I don't want empty platitudes saying I'm doing a good job when I'm clearly not. I just want to know I'm suffering and not alone.

Now the food noise and bingeing urges have come back and I am feeling very distressed. My stomach hurts, from all the snacking I've been doing the last while. And I feel so anxious about this. I'm even considering going back on the GLP-1, but realistically know I can't maintain or afford it.

Those calorie-laden stir frys and late night snacks caught up to me. Before I knew it, my size 32 pants and medium shirts were getting uncomfortable and I couldn‚Äôt justify going out in public in them. They, and I, looked *bad.* 

I stepped on the scale last week and knew what was coming. I knew that weight had gotten to a point that I couldn‚Äôt ignore anymore. 224.9. Ugh. 51 pounds up. Half my work had gone down the drain. 

Why is it that starting the weight loss journey (or, perhaps more accurately, *restarting* the weight loss journey) is the most difficult?

I lost two pounds this week but the two weeks before I stalled because I settled for eating at maintenance. Now I‚Äôm worried that if this is a problem now, how will it be when I hit my goal weight? What if I stop tracking or overeat again and end up where I started? If I lose this last 10 pounds it‚Äôll be a 40 pound weight loss, I lost 30 pounds in three and a half months so I know gaining it back wouldn‚Äôt take long. 

And now, to lose that last 10 pounds I‚Äôd have to cut my deficit back again and I was already struggling before. My deficit now is 1,300-1,500 and if I chose maintenance it‚Äôs 1,700. Honestly 1,700 is just my estimation. What do I do? I think I really messed up because in the beginning I literally ate the bare minimum to drop weight fast PLUS walk a few miles a day. Now I‚Äôm at my current weight (174.6 pounds) and I can‚Äôt lose anything without cutting back significantly, and now MyFitnessPal is saying I need to eat 1,300 calories a day to lose 2 pounds a week.

1jzva59,loseit,My inner big back is trying to revive,"Long story short, I lost 40-45lbs last year. I was doing great in maintenance, in fact staying in my goal range without a lot of effort. At Christmas I began to indulge more and more, and still my weight didn't really change! So I made the stupid mistake of kind of letting go of thinking about food at all. 

As much as it wasn't super effortful being in maintenance that first 6 mos or whatever, I wasn't tracking but I was still being *mindful*. I was still not having ""junk"" food in the house most of the time, but also avoiding other really high calorie foods like nuts. I was still measuring some things and generally doing similar portions to my weight loss journey. I was packing a nutritious low calorie lunch. More importantly, I was not turning to food for comfort, and was tolerating hunger as being normal sometimes. 

Then, a major stressor came up in my life about 6 weeks ago. Because I'd already been giving myself permission to eat what I want, I then started stress eating again...

Now, I'm lucky that I don't crave things that would skyrocket my weight. I'm still reigned in compared to my younger days. So I'm only up a couple lbs. My desired range was 160-165lbs (176cm woman) and I had been 162-163 most of the time. Now, I'm hitting 165-166. It should only take me a few weeks to lose these few lbs again so it felt unimportant... but this morning, my post-weightloss jeans fit snug. I refuse to go back to big back life!!! It's not for me!!! Here is my commitment to calorie count til I see 162 on the scale again.

I genuinly feel like weightloss communities are so uninclusive the moment you're not in the standard. I'm so tired of being accused of having an ED when i just state facts. If i ate 2000 calories a day with my current lifestyle i would take on weight.

1jztrmx,loseit,Feeling better & Looking Better Tips: Manage Your Inner Conflict,"These are a few lessons I have drawn from my weight loss journey of almost a year. 

First, I had no explicit, set goal. 

My motivation was not because I was obese or had to meet any physical standards beyond improving my health. My blood pressure and blood sugar were through the roof. 

Before this, I had started a daily mental health practice. Through that I became aware that my mind was not monolithic. It had parts that were in conflict with each other.

The underlying neurobiology also confirms this. Different circuits in the brain are responsible for different things. Sometimes, you feel pressed to take a leak, but most of us can compel ourselves to hold on. Potty training is about all that. One brain circuit overrides another.

It gets even better than that. With the placebo effect, the brain can actually override feelings of pain by activating other systems that make the pain go away.

The challenge really is how to regulate our mind and body around the goals we set or the activities or task we have to perform.

Once, I decided to lose weight, some parts of me were happy and other parts were positively dead set against it.

I used my daily meditations to engage in convos with these parts of me to calm my overall system down. The parts who were excited included some that hated the way I looked. I'll be honest: this was a problem.

Self-hate is a damaging thing in the long run no matter how small it is. It's worse when we are not conscious of it. I had just tolerated myself by making fun of my beer belly, love handles and more.

But that did injury to other parts of me that held my self-worth.

I used the meditations to tackle all this.

Then there were other parts of me that positively hated the idea of weight loss. I love food. These parts of me went into a frenzy.

How were we going to cope with hunger? What if I passed out while driving or something? Give up ice-cream and chocolates? Never.

The parts of our minds can come up with some really crazy shit.

I sat with these too and had to calm them down.

At the end of the day, this is the most important part of a weight loss goal: managing inner conflict.

It never really ends. We can only converse with ourselves to pipe things down. Of course burying our feelings and emotions is always an option. 

That's another survival tactic of the mind. But the problem with this is that the conflict is taken elsewhere. Your parts will fight it out elsewhere.

I always tell people that these parts are all just us. They are like relatives whom we hardly know who are bent on seeking the best for us even though they could sometimes be mistaken.

The key is to know and befriend these parts and begin to influence them to the point where the conflict is greatly reduced.

There's another reason why it is important to do this long before you start a weight loss journey. You are going to fall off the wagon. At that moment, your response is critically important.

Some people beat themselves up. I learned to stop doing that. I realized that it was a part of me that was driven by something to push me off the wagon. I would acknowledge and accept it as a part. Then sit with it to get to know why.

Once I understood its story, I could help it change it.

I also had to work with that part of me that beat me up each time I abandoned the plan.

Thing is, I was slowly changing me.

Today, I am still on the journey. I have fallen off the wagon many times. I get back on and restart on the plan.

I see this as a lifestyle change meaning I'll have to put it into practice for the rest of my life.

Overall, I have lost about 40lbs in about 6 months. My health indicators are much better now.

In my next post, I'll talk about the practice of counting and measuring on a weight loss journey.

Feel free to ask questions, DM me etc. We are all on this journey together.

Good luck to all of you.

1jzti84,loseit,Does anyone have a solution to avoiding water weight after eating out and drinking (while staying within your deficit)?,"So I have been doing an average of 14k steps a day for 5 weeks now. Started out at 10k per day and slowly increased to 20k per day or more when I can. My boyfriend and I will drink once or twice a week and order out. But I have been really good at maintaining my deficit on those days / for the week. Even so, those days I eat fast food and drink I‚Äôm gaining back a LOT in water weight. It‚Äôs so frustrating! It feels like my progress has really stalled because I‚Äôm looking to lose 5 more pounds (10 total from my initial weight) and I feel like I‚Äôve been stuck in a cycle this last month of getting 3 pounds away from my goal then gaining 5-8 pounds in water weight. I make sure to drink 60-80 L of water a day (I have a 40 L water bottle I try to drink 2 of). 

I will lose the water weight from the alcohol and the pizza or whatever food in about 4 days and then be back at my original weight (after the 5 pound loss) before the eating out instead of moving down further. 

I‚Äôm religiously getting my steps in which consists of walking and jogging. I‚Äôm also very strict with weighing food and have everything completed before I even drink (so that way I know what I‚Äôve consumed in alcohol and food calories without having to try to remember if I ate extra when I got drunk munchies or something) And I want to be able to live a normal life while not obsessing but the water retention and very slow weight loss bothers me. I have a 500 cal deficit or more a day and I should be at my goal weight since I‚Äôve been at this regimen for 5 weeks now. I‚Äôve heard alcohol can cause your body to store all of the fat that you eat regardless of the exercise you‚Äôve done that day or the calorie deficit you‚Äôre in for that day. Does it really override CICO? Should I just cut out drinking for this next month and still indulge in foods I like while staying in my deficit? Should I cut out alcohol and fast food until I reach the goal? It‚Äôs very annoying because I know I‚Äôm moving in the right direction but it‚Äôs just going much slower than I want it to.

1jzt8bd,loseit,Strength =/= Health,"To preface, I am a former competition powerlifter. If you've seen how powerlifters eat you know it's a lot. During my teen years, my trainers would push more calories, more protein, more, more, more. 

This was an escape from the 90s diet culture that pushed fad diets, and that my mother bought into full force. She has also struggled with weight as well, but tries to maintain it through everything from Weight Watchers, Body for Believers, Low Carb, and now Carnivore diets. 

This all to say, I got strong. Really strong. But I was always large. My BMI is and will always be overweight-obese. This led to body image issues, excuses, and lots of bad habits that are hard to unlearn

Now I am back in the gym. Training high reps to failure, doing more super sets, and hitting Cardio for my heart. Changing the mindset of strength to weightloss is hard, and going down in weight to get the appropriate reps can be disheartening.

1jzscc9,loseit,My small but big feats these past 10 days,"Just to make things clear from the start. I have never managed to do these things before. And although it is going to sound very insignificant, it means a lot to me. I actually feel confident in the fact that I'll finally be able to do this. 

I have always been overweight. I am 160cm (5'2) and around 80kg (170 lbs). I recently found out how much I weigh and I've officially gone from just being overweight to being classified as obese. This has really shifted my perspective and I finally decided enough is enough. I know everything that I need to do, I'm just being stubborn and not acting in my best interest. So when I tell you that in these past 10 days I have done things I never thought were possible for me I mean it. 

1. I have eaten in a deficit every single day. Usually I give up after 2 days max. 

2. I went for a walk everyday. And now I almost crave it. I truly feel better afterwards.

3. I have only drunk water and tea.

4. I managed to not go for seconds. This has always been my biggest problem. 

5. I was able to control my urges and say no to myself. 

6. I'm fine with the feeling of being a little hungry. I just remind myself that I will eat in the near future and that I'm not gonna starve. 

7. My 5 pack of ramen has lasted longer than a week. I buy a 5 pack of ramen and it's usually gone in 4 days. Right now there is 1 pack still sitting in my cabinet, and I don't feel the urge to eat it. 

8. There is a bag of chips in my cabinet and I don't even think about it. I don't know why this time is so different, but I genuinely don't feel the need to eat it. Usually the only thing I think about is junk food if I have at home. This is truly mind-blowing to me.

9. I was actually able to eat in moderation. What I mean is I was able to eat the things I like in their actual recommended portions. I have eaten a candy bar at least 3 times this past week. But the thing is, I only ate one. It's so nice to know that I can still eat the things I want, that I don't have to cut anything out. If anything, calorie counting has brought me such comfort. I understand that it's not for everyone but it truly helps me keep myself accountable but still be able to indulge as long as I budget my calories accordingly.

10. This is the biggest one for. I went to the dining hall and only ate half of my plate. I grew up in a household where I wasn't allowed to leave my plate half eaten and got yelled at for doing so. But yesterday, I ate half and left the rest of it. I never thought that I'd be able to do it. But here I am. 

I have been fat my whole life. I know that there's still plenty of time for me to mess up, but I'm feeling hopeful like never before. This time I want weight loss more than anything else. I want to be healthy, I want not to be out of breath doing simple exercises. I want to learn how to eat in moderation. I wasted my teenage years starting and stopping losing weight and never succeeding. And we only get one life. I don't want to waste my twenties doing the same thing. It's time that I take charge of my life, cause no one else is going to do it for me. ",15,3,1744724927.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jzscc9/my_small_but_big_feats_these_past_10_days/

If you‚Äôve been trying to lose weight and feel stuck or overwhelmed, following a structured program can really make a difference. I used to jump between diets and random workouts, but once I committed to a plan, things started to feel more manageable.

A good program gives you clear guidance on what to eat and how to move. No more guessing. It also helps you track your progress, which keeps you motivated ‚Äî seeing even small improvements builds momentum.

Most programs also come with tips from experts or a supportive community, which is super helpful when you're feeling unmotivated or unsure.

The key is to choose a program that actually fits you ‚Äî your lifestyle, your goals, your pace. Don‚Äôt stress about being perfect, just stay consistent. That‚Äôs where the real change happens.

So, nearly a month ago (29d to be exact) I posted here saying i had finally hit only 10lbs from healthy. However, this was untrue, as I had an analog scale that was... well analog. It didn't give me consistent numbers and i had to go by an average.

About 2 weeks ago, I got a digital scale. Being ""166"" at the time, i figured i would be close to that. Maybe 168 at most. Nope, it read 170.2.. 

Knowing that i was off for a full 6 months of what my weight truly was, was a bit saddening. But at least the loss is the same, its still real.

Back to the point of this post, today i got on the correct scale, and it read 164.4, which was nice after nearly 2 weeks being stuck at 166.2-165.8, only going down to 165 yesterday.

According to BMI, I'm currently at 26.6, and 154.4 will put me at 24.9, which is technically a healthy weight.. Barely. Now that I'm actually at this goal, its incredible to see my progress. I started my journey thinking i was only 165lbs, and now being under that? I see how people just gain 100s of pounds without thinking. I'm glad I was able to stop before it got too bad.

1jzphgb,loseit,How I eat more vegetables - Greek yogurt dips,"If anyone is looking for a great way to incorporate more vegetables in their diet without adding a ton of unnecessary calories, while also getting a good amount of protein, you should really try out some Greek yogurt based dips. I love being able to eat a plate of veggies and whole bowl of dip while staying within my calories and getting about 30g of protein. Here is my base recipe for my favorite Honey Sriracha dip and then some other dips you can try too. Or feel free to make up your own, the possibilities are endless. 

(Ingredients mostly listed in grams because I measure them to count my calories that way, spices are pretty much all eyeballed, I usually add way too much)

Honey Sriracha dip:

300g greek yogurt,
50 sriracha (more or less depending on how spicy you like it),
25g low fat mayo,
1-2 tbsp lemon juice or white vinegar,
12g honey,
(Can add 1/2 or 1 packet of splenda if you like it sweeter),

Msg (can omit if you want),
Onion powder,
Dried diced Onion,
Garlic powder,
Pinch smoked paprika,
Parsley,
Pepper,
Salt (to taste),

Serve with cut up celery, broccoli, English cucumber, carrots, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, radishes, snap peas, and anything else.


Other dip ideas:
(Each would start off with a base of Greek yogurt and a bit of light mayo, and any spices that are complimentary)

Sour cream and onion - replace some yogurt with low fat sour cream, caramelized onions

Tzatziki - grated cucumber, dill, lemon juice

Crab Rangoon - imitation crab, low fat cream cheese, green onion

Honey buffalo

Cajun - Tony Chachere seasoning

BLT - bacon bits and diced tomato

Jalapeno cheddar

Spinach artichoke

Honey mustard - honey, Dijon mustard, mustard powder

Chipotle - can of chipotle peppers in adobo, sour cream, honey, lime

i lost 34 lbs from january 2024 to july 2024. and the most important part: i have been able to sustain it since then.   
i was so proud of myself. i felt much better and had more energy. my confidence was also up.   
  
now i want to start the next cycle of reducing weight. again using CICO and walking 1 hour every day. and suddenly i am really afraid. it seems to me, that the ""middle"" part between starting weight and goal weight is really hard. when i had just lost the first 34 lbs/ 15kg i was really happy - now at my new ""normal"" it feels like i have accomplished nothing because i am only a third of the way to my goal.   
  
how do you handle negative self talk in the ""middle"" of a weight loss journey?   
and maybe you can give me a bit of outside encouragement: i have accomplished something, right?

We bought a Garmin Index S2 scales which suggests her body fat % was 29.9% on March 27th and is now 31.6% on April 15th.

I have been using this [Online Calculator](https://www.calculator.net/calorie-calculator.html) with activity set to Moderate since she does running 3-4 times per week. That suggests that 1Kg per week weight loss would be at 1526 calories in per day. Her sports watch's (Garmin Forerunner 265) calories out measurement is 2445 per day between March 19th and April 15th. So with these 2 way of measuring in mind even if they were out by a little bit I would still have expected a similar decrease in weight to what she was seeing in the months last year.

She has made tremendous progress and as far as I can tell her eating has been very disciplined (we have a little sheet we record down the meals/foods for the day) so I highly doubt she is sneaking food or incorrectly recording it.

We tried getting her to have a mix of low and high days whilst keeping the average the same in March and now in April to see if that would shake up her metabolism but it doesn't seem to have done much (except that its become a more preferential eating schedule).

Pushing the diet down to 1200 or even lower seems a little scary. Doing even more exercise than the 3 hours a week she does currently seems like a lot.",0,10,1744713983.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jzoqj9/partner_is_stuck_on_a_weight_plateau_even_in_a/

Height: 194cm

Weight: 122kg

Age: 25

Exercise: Moderate 4-5 times a week

  
It thinks my maintain level should be 3300kcal.

This is so far off its incredible, my maintain level is actually just 2000kcal.

And yes, I weigh every single meal down to the gram and Ive done this for months, I focus on high protein low carb foods, usually I end the day with around 120g of protein.

I am not losing weight.

My exercise consists of 1 hour bodybuilding type training 3 times a week. I feel completely spent after every session. 

The additional exercise is either a 35 minute jog or a 1.5 hour bike ride, or both in the same week but thats not usually the case since then I dont feel recovered enough in the gym.

Sleep is at least 7 hours a day, apparently good quality according to a fitness tracker.

Average 4.4k steps a day

  
My question is, what could cause the calorie counter to be so far off target? I guess my non-exercise movement like steps per day is lower than average, but I also carry a lot of muscle mass so I would think it offsets that.",1,12,1744711632.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jzo5a1/how_accurate_are_calorie_calculators/

1jznswl,loseit,How to mentally cope with weight gain from going on vacation etc?,"I‚Äôve been on my weight loss journey since November 2023, and I‚Äôm proud of myself for changing my lifestyle in general, eating better, calorie counting and going to the gym/swimming/walking more. I‚Äôve lost around 60lbs from doing so, and it‚Äôs improved my life in so many ways.

When I first started the weight was just falling off, a lot at first then it was coming off steadily so I was pleased with my progress.

At the start of this year, I went home for Christmas, had a few days of eating more food than usual and drinking, and I put on about 4/5 lbs. I also entered into a relationship with a foodie lol. I‚Äôve been going out for more meals than I would usually do, but have generally chosen the healthiest options. I‚Äôve requested that the meals we cook together fit into my calorie allowance, we go for long walks and he is happy to join in with my healthy lifestyle etc, but I do think that I have found it harder to lose weight now that I am in a relationship! 

So yeah, this year the weight loss has been excruciatingly slow and difficult. I know I am a lot smaller than when I started, but even before Christmas/the relationship I was still losing a bit faster than I am now. It feels like every pound is insanely hard to lose. I am getting very disheartened with the whole process as I still feel like I am trying very hard (going to the gym etc). 

I recently went on my first vacation with my partner, and because I had been feeling so discouraged with my weight loss and missing being able to eat like a ‚Äúnormal person‚Äù, I had a break for the week we were there. I loosely counted calories but decided to just enjoy myself, to get the morale back up.

I‚Äôve come back, waited over a week to weigh myself again (while going straight back to CICO), and I‚Äôve still put on about 3/4lbs. It just shocks and irritates me how easy it is to put on weight, and how incredibly difficult it is now to lose a pound. I‚Äôm probably losing a pound a month on average now, whereas last year it was a pound a week.

I think I‚Äôm just getting impatient really. I‚Äôm so close to getting into the 170s, but the slightest thing keeps pushing my weight back up. I know it‚Äôs an arbitrary number but I can‚Äôt help it. This weekend we have the Easter weekend, so more food and drinks with family, and my resistance is getting weaker the harder it gets.

Any advice from people that have been in this situation or who can sympathise would be great. I tried not weighing myself for a week but still calorie counting, and that helped me mentally (and helped me stick to the plan as my mood wasn‚Äôt being affected daily by the number on the scale), but I‚Äôm concerned if I keep that up I won‚Äôt be holding myself accountable.

I was eat healthy, lots of veggies, proteins, one glass of wine per week, but sometimes a homemade dessert ( like a slice of apple pie around twice de week). My portions are normal. Once spoon of olive oil a day, the rest is steamed.

I exercice moderately ( cycle 40 min. Everyday, walk 30 min at least, hiking once a week, fitness twice a week, badminton one a week.

I feel like I‚Äôm loosing control, I restrict myself a lot and feel very anxious when I have to eat something I didn‚Äôt cook‚Ä¶

I feel frustrated and angry from seeing people stuffing themselves and staying thin while I feel so guilty when eating a small plate of pasta with homemade tomato sauce and bell pepper to the point where I feel the need to fast the following day ( I try not to but I can‚Äôt help thinking about all the fat I‚Äôm storing).

I know this it not healthy but I can‚Äôt help it‚Ä¶

And I still feel fat ( one of my colleague told me I surely stuff myself at home because I don‚Äôt eat cakes and pastries with the others at work).

My mom criticizes everytimes my thick thighs and big ass, and says that I have the same morphology as my severely obese grand aunt ( thanks mom) , my dad points out my double chin and say I should work out and restrict myself more ( I already do but well)‚Ä¶

I know 1200 is too low FYI, I had a super busy day yesterday and skipped breakfast that I had already logged.

1jzkszh,loseit,Hormones/missing period/ confusing ‚Äúmaintenance‚Äù calories,"Looking for words of wisdom/anyone who‚Äôs been through something similar/ support 

24F 
I‚Äôm 4‚Äô11 and I started a cut back in November. I‚Äôm a professional dancer/ dance teacher. I‚Äôm not performing in a dance show contract year round, I try and do 2-3 shows a year (each contract usually lasts about 3-4 months) but I do teach jazz and ballet to littles. 

I naturally lost 25-30lbs over a year without calorie counting, I didn‚Äôt even realize I had lost it until people started pointing it out. I bought a scale just cuz I was curious and then wanted to see if I could lean out a tiny bit more. Just wanted to lose like 5ish more pounds. I‚Äôm very new to calorie counting so I followed a TDEE calculator online and it placed my maintenance at 1600. Everywhere recommended a 500 cal deficit for weight loss and I thought that was CRAZY because no way could I eat just 1100 cals a day so I decided to go slowly and eat between 1300-1500 calories a day. Everywhere online said that for my height and weight, that was standard so I didn‚Äôt think I was under eating. 

I started running 3 miles 2x a week with 15 minutes of pilates 3x times a week. Then in January, I started a new dance contract and it was pretty intense. We rehearsed 4hrs a night during the week and 8hrs on both Saturday and Sunday. This is a normal schedule for me but in this particular show, I got hired as the choreographers assistant and was put into every single number so it was a lot of movement. I also taught baby ballet 5 days a week, 5hrs a day (my full time job) but I never felt like this was a lot of movement because it‚Äôs so simple. 

Fast forward to now (April), I‚Äôve missed 3 period cycles and officially got diagnosed with amenorrhea and an energy deficiency. For the last 30 days I‚Äôve been trying to recover it. My dance contract ended 2 weeks ago and I‚Äôve basically been laying in bed whenever I can and trying to be in a surplus. I figured the quicker I can regain my cycle, the sooner I can get back to exercising. The thing that‚Äôs MIND boggling me is I was maintaining (possible plateau?) 100-103lbs on around 1500cals (I prefer to look at weekly averages) but after 30 days of an average of 2000cals, I‚Äôm fluctuating between 103-105? I was so sure bumping up 500 cals would make me gain weight like crazy but it hasn‚Äôt?? Now I have no idea was my maintenance is but I know that it probably is a lot more than 1600. 

The cool thing about me tracking everything is that I can look back at all the data. I can see that I was unintentionally eating very low fat and low carb. I don‚Äôt think this helped me out. But I also didn‚Äôt feel like I was restricting food? I ate tons of fruit and veggies and ate dessert and takeout when I wanted. 

TLDR: accidentally gave myself amenorrhea and the super slow weight gain from my recovery surplus is making me question what my maintenance calories actually are. 

I guess I‚Äôm looking to see if anyone has any similar experiences ",3,7,1744697677.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jzkszh/hormonesmissing_period_confusing_maintenance/

I don't exactly know what caused it? I've kept the same (ish) lifestyle for most of the time, and don't eat much either (you can basically say its OMAD plus a snack or two) and live a semi sedentary lifestyle. I know that weight loss is no easy task but I feel like I've had an extra hard time compared to a lot of people... is it hormonal?

The only major difference is that this past year I've moved from eating at my uni's dining hall to cooking my own meals but... they aren't unhealthy? Granted I do consume a lot of carbs (e.g. noodles/pasta) but I don't even eat them that often, a lot of my meals consist of eggs, veggies, rice, and chicken.

Edit: My roommate on the other hand is arguably more sedentary than I am and eats way more, but is like 10x slimmer than I. I know its genetics at that point but I've had a noticeable belly since middle school and hate seeing it every time I look at myself.

1jzfcka,loseit,How do you deal with calorie perfectionism and exhaustion?,"I recently had a wakeup call because of a damn sausage roll and since then I've had 17 straight days of being STRICT with calories and walking consistently and I actually lost 2kg! That was so encouraging to actually see the scale go down. That sort of thing would've taken me like a month before.

But today...I had 2 shots of rum and it just sent me down munchie lane. I don't usually drink, very rarely, but life was feeling so stale and repetitive and I just needed to feel something. Also the fact that I had to calculate the calories in the rum first left me feeling kind of dead inside. I've been feeling dead inside when it comes to food these days. I'm scared of foods, I avoid things I like just because I can't risk them being more calories than I thought. If my app can't track a food, I won't eat it, and sometimes I want to. I feel like my tracking has to be perfect so I have like 3 apps and have to cross check across them to make sure one isn't underestimating foods. I have to do this BEFORE I can even start making the food. I'm unhappy a lot these days, is this normal? I have no one to talk to about it. And when I think about how much more I have to lose (15kg) and how much longer I have to keep this up, I get so discouraged.  

So now I've overeaten today and for me it's especially scary because for ME it's a slippery slope and if I'm not keeping a tight grip on my calorie intake I can lose control and it all goes to shit. I'm full right now; I haven't felt ""full"" for 2 weeks and that sensation makes me feel like a failure. I took pride in my ability to be comfortable with just enough and even less and I feel like all that progress is meaningless now, even though logically I know it's not. It's just how I feel. I've seen more progress in 2 weeks than I have in years of trying and I don't want to lose it all. Like why am I here in tears because I'm 120cals over my budget? 

Basically, how do you stop feeling like shit and spiralling after a binge. How do you combat calorie perfectionism? How do you keep going when weighing every goddmaned thing and calculating everything before you can even think about your next meal gets exhausting.

It is not my first time but everything is going relatively smoothly, i eat around 1200-1400 calories a day(im a woman) except every one or two weeks and even then it‚Äôs not fast food but rather restaurants and try to stay on maintenance calories or even a bit less. I enjoy the healthy stuff i cook everyday and the salads so no problems when it comes to that but everytime i try to lose weight it‚Äôs the same problem. I can‚Äôt stay without sugar forever. And by sugar i mean the unhealthy stuff that is just for the pleasure of it. Not fruits or dark chocolates. I can cut it out entirely for one, two or even  three months but when i go completely cold turkey i start having crazy craving and explode one day, it already happened to me before despite me being very close to my goal weight back then. 

So what im doing now is changing my approach, i started including sugary stuff into my meal plans while sticking to my calorie budget and having my proteins. Of course i dont do it everyday, but still more than once a week, for example i leave extra calories for icecream, or have a tablespoon of chocolate in a toast or a cookie etc. And obviously it‚Äôs not a crazy amount as i can control myself fairly well, i count how many calories that took and in a way it gives me something to look forward to as i forget sometimes im dieting even. Now the question is: being brutally honest and concrete how bad is that going to be for weight loss and especially FAT loss. I already lost around 8 pounds, which obviously includes waterweight but since im at the beginning of the journey i still can‚Äôt see big changes. I know the weight loss as in the number of the scale is a matter of CICO ( so i know the weight itself will go down despite me eating that) and my weight is not even very bad compared to my height( im in the middle of overweight in BMR)  buti still have lot of fat, and my goal is mainly to lose that. 

So now everytime i have a snack i feel somehwat guilty because what if wasting all my effort and planning for a small craving. If eating sugar would prevent the fat loss then i can limit it to just once a week + i want to start strength training soon and same question i wonder if that type of snack is bad for building muscles

1jzcop1,loseit,will this work ?,"I (31F 150lbs) had a bit of a health scare last year and realise that I need to get into shape. The only thing I did was start tracking calories.

I'd appreciate some advice about when to add weightlifting to my weight loss plans. I've been very inspired by this sub, and started calorie counting for real at the end of January. Very excited to have gotten out of obese category into merely overwork. I'm calculating my TDEE at around 2000, and aiming for 1500cal/day but not stressing if I get up to 1600. I'm conscious of protein; I'm tracking on paper, not an app, so I haven't been able to count it precisely, but I'd say I'm getting 80-100g/protein on average. Could be more, I don't pay attention to a few grams here and there in veggies, bread, potatoes, etc; I'm just looking at the labels on meat, fish, yogurt and, and so on. 

At first the only movement I added was ten minutes of YouTube cardio videos every day. But it became a habit, and now I'm up to 1 hour of running in place/intense aerobics 5-6 days/week (my schedule is very busy with children, I don't have a lot of other time that I can count on for exercise; I've tried other methods in the past, and always fail because life disrupts my exercise plans and then I can't get back in the swing).

I used to do Crossfit, so I enjoy working with weights, and I want to eventually get back to my old gym. However, that would cost me nearly 2 hours/day (with driving and all) and wouldn't give me as much actual intense exercise as I'm getting with my home routine. I hesitate to start that right now, because I don't want to spend the time and make myself more vulnerable to disruptions that knock me off my plan, plus I'm enjoying seeing the scale drop in a pretty linear way, and I'm afraid to mess with my head by gaining water and muscle weight right now. 

So my question is, is there a major reason that I should decrease my cardio exercise to start doing weights (eg dumbbells at home), or is it OK to keep doing what I am until I hit a plateau or get to my goal, and then start working on muscle?

1jzaxex,loseit,"I would have given up before,  but I‚Äôm not anymore","I‚Äôve been weighing myself daily for two weeks. As well as exercising and counting calories.

Normally I know not to weigh daily but what happens is weekly, I‚Äôll mentally go oh, I will just skip a week. Then stop weighing in completely.

Anyways, the first week I lost 1.4 lbs and yesterday I was down a total of1.6 lbs, so was hoping I would hit 2 lbs lost total (my goal is to lose 15 lbs in 3 months for my next dr appt) since today is my weigh in day and even on my period and everything, I kept moving. I didn‚Äôt overeat. I did everything right. Then I stepped on the scale and I‚Äôm back to my starting weight.

So I decided to look at what I ate yesterday and I had a lot of salty food. A slice of pizza from the food court at Costco, white cheddar popcorn, and some Parmesan crackers. I did drink plenty of water but think that was it.

So, I‚Äôm just going to trek on and keep on grinding. Hopefully it pays off long term.

I average 8500 steps per day, I am consistently losing weight, but that little word on my weigh-in app still stings a little.

I weigh less now than I have in 15 years. I had someone I hadn't seen in about a year stop and do a double take Friday because he didn't recognize me. I know there's progress being made. I'm just bemoaning the fact that I've worked so hard and still haven't made it out of that dreaded category.

I'm getting close I think. Something like 5 lbs until I dip into the ""overweight"" range. It's such a nagging little thing. I'm not sure i'll ever get down into the ""normal"" range.

1jzai19,loseit,Headed to the gym for the first time since high school... How do I not make a fool of myself?,"I am about a year into my weight loss and I am 55lbs down. In recent weeks I've noticed that I have finally lost enough weight that the burden on my joints doesn't leave me stiff and practically unable to move by the end of the day. Non-scale gains yay!

In addition, I have reached a bit of a plateau in my loss, so I bit the bullet and signed up for a gym membership. My day job is fairly active, and I am usually able to hit my 10,000 steps just from a typical workday and that was enough activity up until this point. I'm interested in slowly increasing my physical activity with strength training preferably so I can build some more muscle and increase my BMR.

So like the title asks, how do I do this without making a fool of myself? I haven't been in a gymnasium since high school in the early aughts. Zero knowledge on proper form, how the various machines even work let alone their names. That would all be okay, I guess what I'm most nervous about is breaking some sort of unwritten gym etiquette code or something. I'm a naturally quiet, introverted person so even getting over the hurdle of committing to work out in a public place where strangers can see me is a feat in an of itself.

So idk where to post this or what to do but;
I was sitting on a bench waiting for my friend; i had her and mine sandwich on the bench. 
Some teens on a bike biked by, they were behind me though since i did not see them and pretended to not hear them lol. (yes it was directed at me since they biked close behind me and no one else was there)
One guy started making pig noises, and then i heard one say that i should get a salad. Which doesnt make sense bc i had a healthy sandwich. 

They obviously said this because i am overweight. I‚Äôm 19, a female with a lot of curves which i have always had. Since my anxiety disorder (agoraphobia & health anxiety), i stopped going outside because i was too scared and i gained like 40kgs in a year. I used to be skinny but now im not.)
This hurt me a lot since it‚Äôs the first time someone bodyshamed me and it felt dehumanizing. I think the boys were like 16, i didn‚Äôt see them bc i was too scared to turn around. 
Any advice or helpful thoughts are welcome.

Update:
I thank u all for the positive and comforting words, they really do mean A LOT.

1jz7hwt,loseit,How do I address diet in my weight loss journey when I have a past with disordered eating (bingeing and emotional eating)?,"Hi! I (28F; 5'8; 214 lbs) am uncomfortable in my own skin but I am really struggling with diet and not seeing results is making me lose motivation. I have always been overweight. When I was 16, I was 145lbs, which was only maintained because of an ED where I only allowed myself to eat 800 calories/day while also being very active. Since then, I have been steadily gaining weight. I have always had a complicated relationship with food as I come from an Eastern European family and the constant comments about my body and what I eat on top being on restrictive diets since I was 12 really messed with me. Unfortunately, I started emotionally eating which led to bingeing when I started university. By the time I was done my bachelors degree (2018), I was about 185 lbs. I also have reverse body dysmorphia where I don't think I am as big as I am. At 185lbs, I felt okay in my body and thought I looked decent until I saw myself in photos with friends where I was always the biggest and clearly overweight compared to them.

In 2021, I reached 210 lbs but I had a lot of free time so I tried to be a bit more active. I lost about 10lbs without much thought just because of this and maintained at 200 lbs until recently. Luckily, I also started to rebuild my relationship with food and completely stopped bingeing and rarely emotionally ate. I think this is because I stopped putting restrictions on food and stopped dieting/calorie counting completely.

In the past 1.5 yrs, a few things changed in my life that led to major stress. I started to emotionally eat again, stopped being as active and gained 7 lbs. This past winter/summer, I started to struggle doing my favourite activities - I'd get super out of breath when hiking, my already existing knee problems would flare up if I went for a jog, I couldn't keep up with my bf when cross-country skiing, etc. So in December, with the help of my bf, we started doing 30 min home workouts together about 3-4 times a week which was a good start and we kept doing it until end of February. I started to feel better but I saw no change in my weight. Then we got a 3-month gym trial and started going every other day to the gym. We have been doing about 1hr strength training each time we go and also adding in about 15min of cardio 2x/week. Ever since we started going to the gym (6 weeks ago), I have gained another 7 lbs (current weight: 214 lbs). I know this could be body recomposition with an increase in muscle or maybe water retention but it just seems excessive... how did I put on 7 lbs in 6 weeks with moderate exercise and no big change in my diet?

I know diet is a huge part of weight loss but because of my past with EDs, I don't feel like I can make a big change because every time that I have in the past, I reverted back to bingeing leading to more weight gain. I am really struggling to find the motivation to keep on my weight loss journey because of this. In terms of diet, I know I am not and cannot be in a major calorie deficit or cut out any foods because it will trigger my bingeing (especially carbs as I don't feel satisfied without carbs). But I also don't feel that I eat too poorly in the first place. I mostly eat at home with a good amount of fruit and veg and drink mostly water. I do like carbs (bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, etc) as I said, without them I feel unsatisfied and if I don't eat them or restrict them, I end up overeating them later on or bingeing. Recently, I counted calories for a week of my normal eating just to see where I was at and it averaged to 1800-1900/day. I know this isn't low enough for a major drop in weight but it is \~600-700 calories less than what I need for maintenance. And that doesn't take into account my moderate physical activity. 

It is really frustrating me that making such a big change in my exercise routine is leading to weight gain and not loss but I also feel that I cannot make a huge diet change because of my problems with disordered eating. I am wondering if anyone has experience with bingeing or emotional eating and figuring out how to incorporate diet changes in their weight loss journey when dealing with disordered eating. I would really appreciate your tips or advice!! 

  
TLDR: I started my weight loss journey mostly by increasing strength training but I have gained another 7 lbs in 6 weeks. I know that incorporating diet changes would help but I am struggling with how to go about it as I have a past with bingeing/emotional eating that leads to weight gain especially when I am in a calorie deficit or if I restrict foods. Any tips or advice is welcome :) Thanks! ",1,3,1744658583.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jz7hwt/how_do_i_address_diet_in_my_weight_loss_journey/

Things like mashed potatoes, beans (french style green beans are okay fsr), applesauce, and many vegetables (the smell of leafy greens like lettuce bothers me too) are awful for me. Even beyond losing weight, being an adult, it's really embarrassing to balk at such common foods. 

I've tried to lose weight before for several reasons (appearance, insulin resistance, etc.), but I always end up gradually falling off from a lack of variety. I know all the ideas (calorie deficits and less carbs for me personally bc of the insulin problems), but it's difficult to execute them, as we all know. I really want to eat *better*, not just lose weight, as I know that I'm not setting myself up for success in the long run without doing so, but it feels impossible with my aversions.

I had a very emotional moment last week where I just decided to be done trying to lose weight.

1jz5qhs,loseit,Discouraged- Advice Wanted,"Hi friends. 
F 27, 5‚Äô7. Started my weight loss journey in Sept 2024 weighing in at 167lbs. In January I got norovirus so I think this helped with a few lbs and I weighed in at 154lbs (Jan 2025). 

Got engaged Feb 15, birthday early March- so between the holidays and early March I was drinking a lot of alcohol and eating whatever with minimal exercise. Somehow- on March 17th when I started a 75day workout plan with my fianc√© I weighed in at 156.6lb only gaining 2lbs which was shocking to me. 

This is where I get discouraged. I weighed in today on the 4wk mark and have gained, weighing in  at 157.8lb. I was hoping it‚Äôd be muscle but it‚Äôs not as you can see in the images- I have smart scale. I‚Äôm discouraged because I‚Äôve been lifting 4 days a week, mainly at 5:30AM which is SO HARD FOR ME and something new i‚Äôve been doing to stay consistent. 20min cardio minimum. In a calorie deficit (which I admit I‚Äôve been guessing with what I‚Äôm eating and I know there are days I go over slightly but I try and be aware of the ballpark and not track every single number). 1 active recovery day. No alcohol. No fast food. But‚Ä¶. I had alcohol on my bday (3 glass wine March 25). 

Other notes- We had a catering tasting so I ate a ton of pasta and some desserts. And I quit vaping (after 9 years)‚Ä¶. and I‚Äôm one week clean. Which has created increased hunger. I‚Äôm craving anything but water as i‚Äôm not drinking alcohol or smoking anymore and I feel like that‚Äôs my vice. I love coke zero. But any other tips for healthy drinks that won‚Äôt hurt my journey are accepted. 

Anyways- any recommendations for losing this stubborn stomach fat‚Ä¶ or any hard truths? I want to finally #LOSEIT now in life more than I ever have.

1jz55st,loseit,How do you manage to count calories?,"I have already done it in the past and it allowed me to lose 7 kilos. I went a little hard by lowering my intake to 1700 kcal and I was sometimes very hungry. Now I would like to go to 1900kal/day. 

When I did this the first time I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù to be unemployed and so that was all I had to do. I already found the exercise complicated because my partner loves going to restaurants (me too). Even when trying to eat healthy it was stressful not knowing how many calories the dish contained. 

Now I have gained 15 kilos following an injury which prevented me from moving for a year and a half. I continue to gain weight even though I eat as healthily as possible. I know the best outcome will be to count calories. I even saw a nutritionist 5 and that wasn‚Äôt enough.

But I have even more obstacles: I eat 3 times a week in the company canteen so it's impossible to know the calories. Even if I have a vegetable starter, meat dish, starchy vegetables and yogurt for dessert, it‚Äôs a mystery.

I go to a restaurant 3 to 6 times a week outside of work. And the rest of the time I need to vary my dishes (which I cook myself).

So counting calories is a headache. And I give up after a few hours. To top it off I take two cases per day. So even more complications to count. And finally my hunger fluctuates during the week... depending on my menstrual cycle as well as my physical activity (I sometimes walk a lot but it's difficult to predict when).

I haven't found a magic app that understands everything the first time. Even photo apps recognize foods and give calories per 100 grams but they can't guess the weight of the food (me neither.)

Yesterday I binged 1~2k over my maintenance calories, and I felt soo bad. Today I woke up thinking I was gonna get back on track, but ended up binging today as well. The day is not over yet and I know that I‚Äôm gonna keep eating until i go to sleep. It‚Äôs the worst feeling and I literally don‚Äôt know how to stop. It‚Äôs like once I ‚Äúlet myself‚Äù binge, I keep going the whole day.  

 I feel like I‚Äôve ruined my whole journey now and I‚Äôm so sad about it. I know a 2 day binge isnt the end of the world but right now it feels like it. Looking at the scale after these 2 days makes me feel awful honestly. 

Tomorrow is a new day and I really do hope I can get back on track‚Ä¶ I have a history with ed though so this is super difficult for me

I feel very alone in this so I just wanted to rant ",4,6,1744652602.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jz4zdm/binged_2_days_in_a_row_i_feel_awful/

But because we walked around the city for the entire day I apparently ended up burning quite a surprising amount of calories (~640) so I stayed within my deficit. That really surprised me, because I didn't expect that a whole day of just walking around could burn that much.

1jz4jt2,loseit,Plateaued the last six months and need advice,"As a brief backstory: I started at 355lbs in 2020, went down to 273 by 2023, and regained thirty pounds over the next six months. Starting February 2024 I began calorie counting and from then to November lost 40lbs essentially just through calorie counting and some light walking.

Since then I haven't lost a pound. Haven't gained any either, and I stayed the same weight through the holidays, but regardless of what I eat or how much I'm stuck at 265lbs and I don't know what to do. It's really demoralizing and I'm afraid to relapsed into unhealthy eating habits, which I've done more than once.

According to Calculator.net I am allowed to eat 2090 calories a day and still lose one pound a week, and 2340 for half a pound, these calculations including little to no exercise (I walk for 30 minutes a day but nothing intense). For the entire time I lost weight I only measured myself in the amount of calories I ate rather than what I was eating, if that changes anything. I eat a lot of sweets and snack foods but even while doing so I've maintained under my weekly calorie limits, and yet I'm not losing.

Is there anything I can do? Was I wrong to rely on the sheer numbers and need to start eating healthier more often as well as begin more intensive exercises?

Thanks for reading. If there's anything else I can add please let me know.",3,10,1744651551.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jz4jt2/plateaued_the_last_six_months_and_need_advice/

i like walking and running on the treadmill, ive gotten a lot of benefits from it and its my preferred workout method so if anyone has any routine recommendations with no incline, that would be perfect!

before anyone asks: i have spoken to my doctor about this, i have 3 diagnosed problems with my lungs and this kind of reaction is very normal for the state of my lungs. i have a daily inhaler as well as an emergency one, i never miss the daily one and i always take the emergency one before working out and i take it after when its needed. the incline really just takes so much more out of me and it‚Äôs not worth it to push through that every single time because im aware that‚Äôs not good for me ",1,11,1744649469.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jz3p5i/treadmill_routines_with_no_incline/

1jz2jlp,loseit,Help avoiding weight loss talk with family,"Hello! I'm 25NB and have been steadily losing weight for the past year (down almost 45 pounds). I haven't been really pushing for it to happen as I've had a lot of weight shifts in my life due to an eating disorder, but have more recently found a healthier relationship with food/eating/Exercise that has in turn helped me lose weight and build more muscle. 

However I'm now worried my ED is rearing it's ugly head again after dealing with my mom. She recently had to be hospitalized in December for acute heart failure, and in turn has now been instructed to lose weight if possible BUT to focus on keeping fluid off her body as it was causing the issues. She is overweight and has been her whole life if that matters. She's been put on a low sodium diet and doesn't need to count calories but does need to watch her salt intake to keep fluid down. This was all fine but she keeps harping every day about how she's ""gone up 1-2 pounds"" but then by the afternoon they're gone. I've tried explaining multiple times that's just what the body does, but she always eats and then says things like ""I'm going to have put on 5 pounds. I'm going to be so fat."" Even if it's just a sandwich. 

It all came to a head yesterday when she said she was going to start starving herself because ""sedentary people don't need to eat as much."" She can do whatever she wants but listening to this has retriggered a lot of my eating disorder thoughts and feelings. I don't mind talking about being healthy or exercise, but she's driving me crazy. Any advice on how to avoid this?

1jz2h04,loseit,"‚òÖOFFICIAL WEEKLY‚òÖ Day 1 Monday: Start here! April 14, 2025","# Is today is your Day 1?

‚Äã**Welcome to** [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit)!

‚ÄãSo you aren‚Äôt sure of how to start? Don‚Äôt worry! ‚ÄúHow do I get started?‚Äù is our most asked question. [r/Loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Loseit) has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that we‚Äôve found most useful for getting started.

# Why You‚Äôre Overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!). In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue. If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use. When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy. The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are. The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

# Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs. You can do that [**HERE**](https://tdeecalculator.net/). This will give you an approximation of your calorie needs for the day. The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat. One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories. So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above). 750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

# Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work. The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake. This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) recommends (unaffiliated) apps like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit](http://loseit.com/) or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/). Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals. This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so don‚Äôt cheat the numbers. You‚Äôll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a **digital kitchen scale** for accuracy. Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating. Why? [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

# Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit? This is up to you. [r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit) has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours. There is no perfect diet for everyone. There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now. If you like pizza you can have pizza. Have 2 slices instead of 4. You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods. Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins. If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you. Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success. If you hate what you‚Äôre eating you won‚Äôt stick to it.

# Exercise

...is **NOT** mandatory. You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone. There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has it‚Äôs own benefits though. You will burn extra calories. Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well. It makes people feel \*awesome\* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

# Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success. That isn‚Äôt necessarily true. Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

# Acceptance

You will *struggle*. We have all struggled. This is natural. There is no tip or trick to get through this though. We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be. If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok. You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress. We don‚Äôt need perfect. We just want better.

Look. I logged for YEARS. Then stopped and logged again for YEARS again. It's exhausting. I'm burnt out on it. Can't bring myself to do it.

1jz1ioy,loseit,Obesity rant,"Being obese is not much of a choice as you might think.

You definitely have the choice to foster a better lifestyle but the bar required to make that choice is ever increasing and will only continue to increase as long as there are massive profits from obesity and obesity drugs.

Government has allowed and helped the obesity epidemic. A lot of money is being made from obesity, and pharmaceutical drugs for weight loss is making a lot of money too. It is a clear path being carved for people to get obese and then spend even more money buying the drugs when the problem of obesity isnt even the peoples choices about their lifestyle anymore when the whole industry is motivated and aggressively exploiting humans and their primal instincts for profit. The food industry uses those profits to keep the government compliant. Its a fucking sewage canal exquisitely carved for humans which they are endorsing.

You still need to fight to make that right choice but unfortunately it will only become harder and harder. We can see this with rates of obesity.",0,26,1744644118.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jz1ioy/obesity_rant/

Granted, I am probably not eating what most would say was enough. I am consuming on average around 800-1000 calories a day, but I feel good! My energy levels are up. My stamina is up, and I feel stronger. I kind of assume that my body is feeding off reserves just now. I cycle between calenetics, weight training and walking 6 days a week. I used to drag my weight the 5 minutes from the train station to my work. Yesterday I did a 4.5 mile walk at a quick pace - by choice!!.

1jz0l95,loseit,How to lose weight healthily?,"hi ‚Äì apologies if this is about to be a long or pathetic post asking for advice. i just feel so lost.

for background ‚Äì i‚Äôm 24, 5‚Äô0 and obese. i weighed in this morning at 246.4 and have been hovering in the 240‚Äôs for at least the last 3-4 years. as you can imagine, on my 5‚Äô frame, this is pretty intense for me.

i‚Äôve always been fat or chubby growing up. i had a very short stint of being <200 in college when i developed an ED. i‚Äôve tried hard to learn and recover since those days but it still haunts me. in early 2023, i was diagnosed with PCOS, which i‚Äôve also tried to learn about and stay informed on. i‚Äôm still learning.

truthfully, i‚Äôm tired. i‚Äôm just so tired. tired of nothing fitting me the way i want it to, tired of being the token fat girl, tired of feeling insecure or unsexy when i‚Äôm supposed to feel beautiful. i know none of these things are inherently true, but it‚Äôs how i feel and how i‚Äôve felt for years. i do not identify with the body i‚Äôm in. i want to lose weight.

i‚Äôve tried intuitive eating ‚Äì i‚Äôm no good at it. i‚Äôve tried calorie counting ‚Äì and it makes me spiral back into my ED behaviors. it was only about 3 months ago the last time i tried, and i found myself crying in the chick fil a parking lot over what i should or shouldn‚Äôt eat. i‚Äôm not interested in any crash diets or weight loss drugs for the time being, because i know they‚Äôre not going to be sustainable for me. i try to be graceful with myself, but i don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs right either. i‚Äôm just lost‚Ä¶ what will be the thing that works for me? i need real, sustainable, life-time long tips that will help me lose the weight and keep it off. 

my latest attempt was simple ‚Äì try to be more conscious of what i eat, how much, and to up my activity level. i was working out 3-4 times a week consistently for about 5 weeks, and eating consciously. since my PCOS diagnosis, i especially try to be more conscious of my carb intake and to focus on protein and fiber heavy meals. i didn‚Äôt step on the scale the entire time, to try and not orient myself to focus solely on the numbers. when i finally did step back on, it broke my heart. not a single. mf. ounce. was gone. it discouraged me so much. i haven‚Äôt really been going back to the gym since, which also disappoints me, but at the moment, im just feel so, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù of everything.

again, sorry if this is just a self-deprecating cry for help. but truly, any advice is welcome. do i need therapy? do i need to try harder? do i need to just accept the fact that i‚Äôll be fat forever? 

how do i lose weight? thank you in advance for any helpful words. <3 ",10,8,1744641835.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jz0l95/how_to_lose_weight_healthily/
1jz0bwv,loseit,Looking for a new app,"Hey all, so I have successfully used calorie counting in the past with MyFitnessPal. I have now been off of that for a while and need to get back into it however my fitness pal now wants you to pay a subscription fee to get barcode scanning. personally I'm not okay with continuing with my fitness pal if this is the case because the price they're asking isn't worth it in my opinion just to add barcode scanning. 
 I have also checked out cronometer, which does allow barcode scanning in the free version of the app however I'm also realizing that just using barcode scanning and calorie entering is not going to help me continue with this as I think I need something lets me scan things like full meals prepared by someone else where I haven't had a chance to enter the weights of food. 
 so, my question now is what would be a good app that would allow barcode scanning and manual entering of food information, along with the ability to use AI to scan a meal in cases like at a restaurant or at a friend's house where they make the meal ahead of time and I can't enter everything manually. 
 Yes, I am aware that AI calorie tracking is not very effective but I need something that's quick and simple to use in the instances that I mentioned above just to guarantee that I actually do enter things and don't just put it off because trying to enter a meal from restaurant is a little bit more difficult or a meal at a friend's house is a little bit more difficult. 
 also, I am willing to spend money on a subscription just $114.95 Canadian is a little bit more than I'm willing to spend at this time, considering that chronometer would allow me to do the same things as my fitness pal that I want without the subscription model if there's no other option. 
TLDR: I'm looking for an app that has barcode scanning manual information entry and AI calorie tracking from pictures of meals, does anyone know any app like that that would fit those needs. also integration with Google health would be a A+",0,2,1744641174.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jz0bwv/looking_for_a_new_app/

1jyzgri,loseit,Losing weight in between babies,"How are you supposed to do it without losing your period and compromising your fertility?? 

I had my baby 7 months ago and have since lost ~30 lbs. it wasn't anything crazy and I had my fair share of cheat days and breaks during vacations and the holidays. My period suddenly disappeared about 2 months ago. For more reference, I walk 2.5 mi a day and do a quick strength training routine 4 days a week.

(I've already called the doctor about it- they'll see me if I miss a third period and I'm already eating at a very slight surplus to try and get it back.)

I see progress videos and photos of women losing weight in between babies with seemingly no issues and when they're done recomping, It appears like their fertility wasn't really affected at all and they can get pregnant again with minimal worries. So why can't I? I'm on the higher end of a healthy weight so I know my body fat percentage isn't too low. I was only losing 3 lbs per month. 

Obviously my reproductive health matters a great deal to me. So of course I'm putting my calorie deficit on pause, it's just really discouraging to see all of my goals slipping away while I try and get my period back- I want to get pregnant again in the next 7-8 months.

1jyymj4,loseit,Extreme hunger after weight loss- i ate an entire rotisserie chicken and was still hungry,"Hi,

I am 36f, approx 5'4 and 130lbs. Currently taking no medicines or supplements except a women's multivitamin and imitrex for migraines, not daily, usually only a few times a month.

I have always had a problem with an unusually bug appetite since I was a kid and have been to too many doctors to count. I don't have diabetes, prader willie syndrome, thyroid issues, or any of the other typical causes of excessive hunger. I have had every test under the sun. When my GP couldn't find anything wrong he told me I have depression and compulsive food behaviors. I have been to numerous mental health psychologists, psychiatrists, and even specialists for eating disorders. Numerous psychologists and several psychiatrists have told me I don't fit the criteria for food addiction, eating disorders, OCD, etc, and they say it's physical and send me back to the GP who sends me back to them and it is this repeated back and forth. 

I never became obese, but I did get to be fairly heavy, at my highest weight I was about 165 lbs. My doctor kept telling me lose weight lose weight, so I did. I began exercising and cut out all refined sugars, which is something I didn't eat much of to begin with (my diet has always been fairly healthy but I would occasionally drink juices and eat prepackaged snacks like chips or cookies. Maybe 1 serving, 2-3 times per week.) Now, i only drink black coffee (1 cup in the morning) and water. I do not eat any refined sugars or Carbs, I cook  everything i eat myself, and I eat a lot of fiber and protein with every meal. Snacks are things like a handful of almonds, a boiled egg, or an apple. My problem is that after losing about 30lbs, I have become constantly insatiably hungry. My stomach is always growling. My GP told me to try various dietary changes, none of which helped. Most recently they has me start ""volume eating"" where is eat a large amount of bulk fiber like vegetables and beans woth every meal to help me feel fuller. I will eat a large meal (last lunch was an entire bag of frozen Brussel sprouts, 4 baked chicken legs, a can of red beans, and an entire baked sweet potato with 1 tsp olive oil and salt). Within about 15 minutes of finishing the meal I am hungry again.

I try to distract myself, go for walks, drink water (I drink 64oz water every day from a measured bottle). I chew gum. I eat healthy snacks. I am just constantly hungry to the point that it is interfering with my life. I'm so hungry all the time it's hard to concentrate, I'm grouchy, and I feel way worse than I did when I was heavier. My health has improved (cholesterol, blood pressure, etc) but I feel like my appetite has become out of control. 

I went back to the doctor and they did the same song and dance about depression and OCD, so I went to yet another mental health doctor who was recommended by the GP for working with people with OCD eating  disorders. I went there and again, this doctor said I am not consistent with  OCD or depression and she thinks it is a physical issue. She told me to ""honor my hunger"" and eat as much as it tool to feel full, whenever I felt hungry as long as I continued to eat healthy foods. So, I tried following her advice to eat whenever I am hungry and eat as much as it takes to feel full. 

In the span of a week, I probably ate more food than the average person eats in a month. For one dinner, I ate AN ENTIRE rotisserie chicken, 4 cups of chopped cauliflower and broccoli, and a plain Greek yogurt cup. I was starving again within about an hour and I ate 2 cups of oatmeal with an entire pint of strawberries mixed in. I gained 5lbs within the week. 

I am now back to controlling my portions, because I don't want to gain weight again and have to keep hearing every doctor tell me all my symptoms are because I am overweight. 

Is there some kind of medication/supplement/herbal remedy i can take to control the feeling of being constantly hungry? I don't need to lose anymore weight, I just can't stand feeling like I am ravenous and hungry 24/7. This can't be normal, I don't even know how I am fitting all the food into my body.",1,8,1744636606.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jyymj4/extreme_hunger_after_weight_loss_i_ate_an_entire/

It just sort of snuck up on me last year. I mean I knew it was happening, I watched myself again and again grow out of pants I‚Äôd bought saying ‚Äúoh these will be too big soon‚Äù. Emotionally, 2024 was intense: some rough times combined with so many happy ones. A bit of stress eating, a lot of social eating. 

I‚Äôm not afraid of ending up back at 100kg. Better mental health (including an ADHD diagnosis and a reckoning with my disordered eating) and discovering types of exercise I love means that, unless something unexpected and lifechanging happens, I won‚Äôt regain to that point. So that‚Äôs reassuring. 

I guess there are two things I‚Äôm feeling kinda low about. The first is that maintenance was so rocky for me‚Ä¶ fluctuating weight is normal but fluctuating over ten whole kilos feels extreme. The second is that I‚Äôm honestly intimidated by having to lose 20kg all over again. On the positive side, I know I can do it, and I know how good it feels in progress too. Once I start to see that difference at 5kg gone or so, it becomes so rewarding. But I also know how tedious and honestly boring weight loss can be. And my life is so different to my first big weight loss under covid, when I had nothing to do but focus on it.

I think, at the bottom of all this, I‚Äôm frightened. I‚Äôm frightened by the fact that I didn‚Äôt just lose and maintain. I‚Äôm frightened of this becoming a pattern of yo-yo dieting and what that would do to my physical and mental health. I‚Äôm frightened I won‚Äôt be able to lose the weight this time for whatever reason. I‚Äôm frightened that this will always be hard for me and that I‚Äôll never be able to relax.

Well yesterday I had some Pizza Hut and a fiber one brownie, way more carbs and cheese and grease than I usually eat, and today I‚Äôm down .6 from my lowest weight. Not to mention, my weight is ALWAYS the lowest on Sunday then shoots up quite a bit on Monday. This low weight happened on a Monday.

Why does this work? Or does it?? I‚Äôm just curious. ",66,9,1744626526.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jyvktp/how_did_this_work_to_break_my_plateau/
1jyvapc,loseit,"Just getting started, need help","22 male. Stats: 170 Pounds, 34 waist 

Target weight is 155 pounds, 32-31 waist

I have always struggled with being a little overweight. I am really trying to take working out/calorie deficit seriously. But I need specifics: ideally specifics on how to trim flank fat, and lower abdominal fat. 

This is my current program 
 Wake up 5-6am: 1 Multivitamin and 1, 1000mg of L Carnitine

10am: is my first meal: it is a small salad: Lettuce, tomato, yellow peppers, jalape√±os, lima beans, pinto beans. (200-300 calories)
With a protein, either fish or chicken (200 calories), water 

5pm: second meal of the day: same thing as the meal before 

7pm: at minimum 1 hour in the gym. This rotates from legs, back, arms.
No matter what I have an abs circuit of 40 deep Russian twists, 3 minute plank and 3 minutes side plank each side. 
 
There is always cardio, rotating from a 2 mile run, stair master for 10 minutes, or incline speed walk for 15 minutes. 

I am just asking for what could be improved. If anyone has any specifics on how to burn the fat more effectively. If anyone has a specific ab workout/ workout in general that helps them/cardio routine. Thank you! ",1,3,1744625374.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jyvapc/just_getting_started_need_help/

In the past year or so, stretch marks have appeared all over my body, and it's really getting to me mentally, but i don't know where to start or what to do.

I am at that age now where i mostly do my own cooking, so i am able to really take control of what goes into my body. I also wanna tackle this now as im young, so it's prime to lose it all and build healthy habits. My confidence is usually quite high, but the weight shatters it sometimes, especially when it comes to how good i think i look.

I have tried a basic calorie deficit and from the i was able to lose 17kg but then Christmas rolled around and i just fell off of it but one good thing that came out of that was im basically completely off fizzy drinks except for the occasional can

Over the weekend I tried on a dress I haven't worn since March 2022. Since I've now reached the weight I was the last time I wore it I figured it should at least fit, but I wasn't prepared for such a difference!

https://imgur.com/a/dYAUHKj

I actually weigh 2lb less in the before photo (left), however at that time I couldn't walk 5 minutes without severe pain and breathlessness, in fact the moment the photo was taken I was fighting tears from walking the length of that lake, and had needed several breaks on the way. On the right I now walk an hour every day at 3.5mph, I stretch and have such a broader range of mobility, I can't remember the last time my lower back or hips hurt.

On paper I could be disappointed in myself for still being 2lb more than I was in that first photo, but the difference gaining some fitness has made is phenomenal. 315lb of fat, compared to 317lb of fat and muscle.",100,11,1744620416.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1jyu57s/the_subtle_differences_thanks_to_body/
1jyt368,loseit,What Does Slow Weight Loss Actually Mean and Tips for Achieving it?,"28M 5‚Äô8 / 410 lbs, down from 425 lbs. 

I‚Äôve seen a few posts about how fast weight loss (more than 2lbs a week, sometimes even more than 1.5 depending on how much weight needs to be lost) can result in gallstones. They sound excruciatingly painful. Not to mention all the other challenges that faster weight loss can bring. 

I know there are a myriad of health consequences of staying at my weight for a prolonged period of time, especially going into my 30s, but I have found a bit of a groove with losing weight, but it‚Äôs more like 2.5 lbs a week. Some people say 1% of your body weight is fine, but I saw a post from someone who lost 80 lbs  (1.53lbs / week) in a year and still got gallstones. 

I‚Äôm so fine slowing my weight loss down to 1 lb a week, but I find it tricky at this weight to reach that level of granular weight loss, especially because my body is still expelling water. 

I‚Äôd appreciate any insights and encouragement around how to lose weight slowly. And any resources on gallstones and how to prevent them would be amazing too. 

One idea I had was finding what 1lbs of weight loss looks like calorically and just eating those foods repetitiously. 

I‚Äôm sure lots of water would help too.

1jyduif,loseit,How do I deal with family commenting on how much I eat?,"I‚Äôm 168cm/5‚Äô6 and right now I weigh 68kg/150lbs. 

I used to count calories but now I eat intuitively by listening to when I‚Äôm truly full and when I‚Äôm truly hungry. 

I have go-to recipes so I know that my meals are always around the 500 calorie mark and if they‚Äôre a little bit under, I get a snack which is a piece of fruit. It means my days are around 1500-1600 a day. I also walk 10-12k steps a day. 

This has been working for me because the scale has been reflecting my weight loss. 

Recently my dad has been commenting on how much food I eat and told me that I eat the most out of everyone in the house. 

I was in the middle of making a vegan cheesecake and he asks how many times I‚Äôve eaten today and I said three. Then he said ‚Äúand then you‚Äôre gonna eat again and then eat one more time at 10pm when everyone has gone to sleep!‚Äù I haven‚Äôt eaten at 10pm like, ever. I hate eating too close to bedtime because it gives me horrible acid reflux and messes with my sleep. 


He commented yesterday too and it just feels like he‚Äôs shaming me for my food choices. Even though I know what I eat isn‚Äôt high calorie, the calories are just spread out more which makes him think that I‚Äôm eating lots of food when really, it isn‚Äôt calorie dense food and if it is, he doesn‚Äôt see the leftovers I have in the fridge because I get full. 


The most confusing part is that he‚Äôs not skinny at all. He frequently buys takeaway food, two weeks ago he bought two different takeaways in one night. He buys bread at least 3-4 times a week and also eats 450g tubs of crisps/chips in the span of three days. 


After I cried about his comments I was just left being really confused and I don‚Äôt understand why he said that. I‚Äôm trying to do this sustainably and it‚Äôs easy this way. 

I stick to portion sizes on packaged foods. I eat mindfully. I make sure to portion out my foods by never using the large dinner plates and filling half my plate with steamed vegetables. I‚Äôm aware about the hunger fullness scale and learning more as I go along. But it just made me feel super guilty for my caloric intake even though I know I‚Äôm in a deficit, is it really too much?

1jyeu4j,loseit,Desperate for help and suggestions,"Hello everyone! I am in desperate need of some help. A little backstory. I am a 36 year old Female. I tried keto years ago and cut my calories to 1200 and saw great progress. About 7 months in, no matter what I ate, I continuously gained weight. Fast forward to now, I am the heaviest I have ever been (close to 240 lbs). I am 5‚Äô4‚Äù and considered morbidly obese (52% body fat with 117 lbs of muscle mass) and pre-diabetic. I have discussed this with my primary care doctor and she sent me to an endocrinologist. The endo tested me for insulin resistance, my cortisol, thyroid, and everything came back within normal range. The endo referred me to a dietitian. The Dietitian suspected that I have metabolic damage from eating in a calorie deficient that that is low for so long. Working with the dietitian, she had me reverse diet up to 1900 calories. She calculates that I should be burning 2200 calories a day) if my body were performing normally. She also has me strength training 3 times a week, getting 8-12K steps daily, drinking a min of 80oz a day, and hitting at least 140g of protein a day and a min of 25 g of fiber. I continue to see no progress after working with the dietitian for 6 months. I suspected that 1900 may be too high for me so she have me the ok to go to 1700. I track my calories and macro‚Äôs in the Lose It App. 

I am unsure if 1700 is still too high for me. Does anyone have any suggestions on what may be wrong here? I recently started personal training to help with my workouts. I am working with all my doctors but I just feel so unheard. I fear that my pre-diabetes will turn into diabetes because nothing seems to be working and my weight is staying consistent. I wouldn‚Äôt mind going on a glp-1 medication however my insurance will not cover it and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket.

1jysd2i,loseit,You CAN live great without carbs,"I‚Äôve got many hates from this group about this topic, so instead of answering on every hate, I will just share my story here.

Yes, carbs are body's preferred source of energy, especially for brain and muscles. 

But if carbs are drastically reduced (like on a ketogenic or carnivore diet), your body switches to using fat for energy. It turns fat into ketones, which can fuel your brain and body in the absence of glucose.

Of course carbs give you things like fiber and quick energy that fat doesn‚Äôt, but you can replace most of it with veggies, supplements, or pills. Not everyone can eat carbs, like me, for example, and that‚Äôs totally fine.

My body is very healthy and I have great energy all the time. Also I‚Äôm programmer, and my main skill is problem solving, and I‚Äôm good at it, so I assume my brain works great as well.

Working two jobs, going to the gym 4-5 times a week, creating calorie tracking app, creating content for ig and youtube, have beautiful family and great life.

I was 195ish at the start of this, 192 now, I'm not doing any crazy diet, I'm just counting my calories (my budget is 1300-1500 a day) and trying to eat a little better than I used to. I used to eat a ton of processed foods, and I have no clue the amount of calories I used to eat in a day. Well, I've always had anxiety and I've struggled with brain fog before this, and I know I'm overweight for my height, so I wanted to see if dieting would help with one or all of these problems. I feel horrible. I feel like in these few weeks my health took a fat nosedive. A few days in, I got a random spike in heart rate and really dizzy, causing me to go to patient first the next day. I got standard bloodwork done and an EKG and they said it looked it looked fine other than some slightly raised white blood cell count, which I was told meant I was probably just getting over a sickness. For a few days that stuff went away, and came back with a vengeance. My heart rate has been crazy the last few days once again, even when I just get up and walk to the bathroom, and I felt like I was gonna pass out twice today. Not to mention my anxiety is worse than ever, which I'm sure contributes, but it feels like more than what I'm used to as far as anxiety is concerned. I've been drinking about 80 fl oz of water a day (not completely ideal I know but it's a major improvement on where I was before), and while I'm not counting my macros too closely, I didn't think I was doing too bad. I don't have a primary right now, but I got an appointment for one ten days from now, but I don't even know how the hell I'm supposed to make it to that point because my health is freaking me out.

I really want to lose weight, especially before September, and I was thinking of going on a 500 calorie deficit (my calculated maintenance is 1795). At the same time, I don't want to wreck my metabolism, as so many health influencers say 1200 calories isn't enough. Can anyone give me any advice on whether this deficit is sustainable for me? At least, can I get some sustainable deficits?

I use my fitness pal, and to lose one kg a week (2 pounds), I have to stick to a 1280 deficit. I've stuck to it for a week, and so far I feel no cravings or a need to binge. I drink around 2 liters a day to feel more full, accompanied with Crystal Light (5 calories). Again, I'm trying not to gain all the weight back once I hit my goal weight and finish my deficit.

1jymdwn,loseit,"Okay back at it with another question, can everyone be skinny?","Me and my friend got into a debate a little over two days ago about the question: Can everyone be skinny? I know there's people out there who can never put any weight on, but there's also people who seem to take forever to lose that first five pounds. Anyways, if people can be naturally ‚Äúskinny‚Äù can people be naturally ‚Äúfat‚Äù too? 

I took the side that everyone can be skinny. I‚Äôve seen numerous people lose weight and look great, and even when people‚Äôs journeys are longer or a little more tough, they still get to their end goal. So, I think when you‚Äôre willing to put in the work, you can lose the weight and be ‚Äúskinny‚Äù

My friend on the other hand argued that not everyone is mean to be skinny and you can gauge this early on. ‚ÄúBirthing‚Äù hips, apparently, are a clear indication of people who are meant to hold onto more weight. Which, understandable, but still, I think you could lose that even if you tend to hold weight in the bottom. She also said people who have more assets like bigger butts and breast are also clear indicators of people who aren‚Äôt meant to be ‚Äúskinny.‚Äù Once again, from watching family members and a few friends lose weight and their journeys, they lost their breast and it was actually one of the first things to go. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm arguing that everyone can be ‚Äúskinny.‚Äù

Ontop of that, continuing, she changed the argument that people who are curvy, and more on the thicker side tend to look weird after weightloss, and she pointed out how the balance and harmony of your body won‚Äôt look correct because you may lose a bit more in your bottom but not your top. She also said most people won‚Äôt achieve the body they want even with the proper training and workout regiment. 

Anyways, I ask all this because I was the topic of discussion. This has always been one of my major setbacks as to why I never start. I do have a bit more assets, and I hold more weight in my bottom and my breast and not as much in my stomach, but I still hold quite a bit. I genuinely am curious about getting to my goal weight, will I actually look weird and not be happy with myself? Was I meant to be a certain weight range that wasn‚Äôt my recommended? 

I‚Äôm losing weight because one, health issues, two, I want to feel good about myself, but I don‚Äôt want to lose it and then feel worse about myself because my weight distribution was weird and I look like a Dorito or something. But everytime I tell her about how I want to lose up to 50-60lbs she gets defensive and says i‚Äôll look weird and be unhappy. I never can figure out whether this is coming from a state of insecurity or if she is telling the truth and just being brutally honest upfront now before I get to far down.

1k2cmwn,diet,Keto or High protein diet if I want to build muscles whilst losing weight?,"Hi this is me + what I have been trying so far.  
  
M 92kg 182cm started 1st april from 96kg (this is day 18) been walking about an hour per day, gym twice a week. I am fully aware that all the ""weight"" I lost is most likely only water weight due to my diet.

I have been doing intermittent fasting between 12-6pm and trying to follow a keto diet. 

My two meals a day are usually a Greek salad + chicken + olive oil, with an egg or two on the side depending on how hungry I feel. And my 2nd meal is usually half a avocado with shrimps, some blue berries with Greek yoghurt and possibly a egg or some almonds or a bite off Parmesan cheese.

I feel like the diet is  not working for me, I think I am failing to hit ketosis. So since I want to build muscles whilst losing weight, I am considering swapping to heavy protein low fat+carbs. To see if I start losing weight. Any thoughts? I also forgot I take a teaspoon of mct oil c8, when I wake up and before my two meals.

I am very inactive during the days apart from my 1hour walk + two days/w gym session.",1,2,1745002553.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1k2cmwn/keto_or_high_protein_diet_if_i_want_to_build/

Having a nice body would be great, but i‚Äôm comfortable in my skin. I‚Äôm just really worried about the health implications that my current diet will / could have on me and my future.

I'm looking for any kind of tips you may have for my situation. Here it is : 

First of, I think I have a quite bad sugar addiction but what I'm about to tell does not apply to sugary food only, just any kind of food I like. 

I have these moment where I start craving for food (sometimes I'm not even hungry) and when I start eating, I can hardly stop until I'm so full that I can't eat a single bite anymore. 

I can eat ridiculous amount of food at a time. It feels good until it doesn't anymore. I start to feel guilty plus  physically ill because I ate so much. 

It worries me because I think of the health issues I could get from this (thinking diabete) and also because I started slowly gaining weight over the year. 

I never did any kind of drastic diet because I know how bad they are. Sometimes I manage to control myself for a while and don't go crazy for a week or so, but I'll always end up doing these massive eating sessions. I don't know why I'm doing this. 

Do you have any kind of advice please ?

1jzkfn7,diet,Corn niblets relieve constipation,"I just wanted to share a personal experience, where I found eating a serving of corn niblets every day relieves my constipation and promotes easy movements.

I briefly switched from corn to peas, eating a serving of peas with my dinner every day, as I read peas have more vitamins and fiber than corn.  After just 2 days of eating peas instead of corn, my constipation came back.  I then switched back to corn, and the constipation went away about 2 days later.

My theory is that, although peas contain more fiber than corn, peas are drier inside.  I find peas quite pasty, and I always feel thirsty for some time after eating them.  They made my stools drier and more difficult to pass.

Whereas corn is wetter and juicier.  Also, I read the outer shell of corn is not digested, and passes through our bodies.  This outer shell is slippery, making stools more slippery as well (my theory).  Corn's outer shell also adds bulk to stools, and keeps them moist for easy passing.

I generally eat half a small tin every day.  I cook them in the microwave for 3 minutes, and add just a little salt.  The small tins I buy are 341 ml / 12 fl oz.  Half of that every day is enough to keep my movements smooth and easy.

1jzbj7p,diet,"Carbs, fats, and satiety hacks: how protein reshapes the way we feel full","When people talk about protein, it's usually in the context of building muscle and working out. But we rarely mention how protein affects hunger and weight, which is actually really important.¬†¬† Some earlier studies found that high-protein diets can help you feel fuller, reduce calorie intake, and help maintain weight loss¬†([Heather L. et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523274274?via%3Dihub); [Moon J. & Koh G., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7539343/)).

Compared to carbs and fats, protein has a stronger effect on appetite-regulating hormones. It boosts GLP-1, PYY, and CCK while suppressing ghrelin, which contributes to a greater sense of fullness and reduced hunger throughout the day ([Moon J. & Koh G. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7539343/)).

There‚Äôs also the thermic effect to consider. Protein takes more effort for your body to break down compared to carbs or fat, which means you burn a bit more energy during digestion¬†([Heather L. et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523274274?via%3Dihub); [Moon J. & Koh G., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7539343/)). While the effect isn‚Äôt huge, it can support weight management over time, especially alongside reduced appetite.

Some studies suggest that around 25 to 30 grams of protein per meal may be the threshold for noticeable satiety effects. Meals below that amount, especially when protein is consumed in liquid form, tend to have a weaker impact ([Heather L. et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523274274?via%3Dihub)).

In trials, higher-protein diets consistently led to more fat loss and better lean mass preservation, even when calories were kept the same between groups ([Heather L. et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523274274?via%3Dihub); [Moon J. & Koh G., 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7539343/)). Preserving lean mass helps maintain resting energy expenditure, which often declines during weight loss.

Even in studies where people weren‚Äôt restricting calories, just eating more protein led to naturally reduced intake. This points to a built-in appetite-regulating effect that doesn‚Äôt require strict dieting to work ([Moon J. & Koh G. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7539343/)).

Despite old concerns, research hasn't found significant harm to bones or kidneys from higher protein intakes in healthy people, especially when staying under 1.6 g/kg/day ([Moon J. & Koh G. 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7539343/)).

1jzavl3,diet,"Gaining weight, but scared of potential side effects!?!","Hey everyone, I'm currently bulking and everything feels great to be entirely honest. My weight is steadily going up, my lifts are getting better, I feel stronger, etc. I have went from 62.3kg to roughly 65.6 in like 8 days, I didn't weigh myself in the morning so my morning weight is probably around high 64 to low 65. 

However! I am slightly worried about my current diet situation that I'm using to achieve said goals. I eat pretty much the same thing every single day so here's a typical day of eating for me.

Breakfast: 5 egg omelette with 100g of frozen vegetables + 2 tbsp of olive oil   
  
roughly 30 min after my breakfast I also have my mass gainer shake (1,200 cal, 50g protein + vitamins)   


Lunch:  
  
Usually post gym, I have a protein yogurt with no fat and a premade chicken pasta dish from the grocery store (Tesco meal deal ifykyk)   

Dinner:

Usually have some sort of protein dish like ground beef and some form of grain. 

  
Here is my concern, I generally eat roughly 3,500 (at the lowest) to 4,200 (at the highest) calories per day and consume roughly 150-180 grams of protein + enough carbs and plenty of fats. People have told me that this diet may be unsustainable and even not entirely safe.

1jx67c9,diet,"We always talk about weight loss, but what really matters are lifestyles that can sustain a healthy weight for a lifetime. Research suggests consuming less of certain nutrients, independent of calories, may significantly help prevent obesity and weight regain.","Obviously losing weight is important, but what does it matter if you just end up regaining it and becoming unhealthy again? Sure you can count calories and get down to a healthy BMI, but once you've reached goal weight, it's not practical to constantly count calories and control your portions for the remainder of your life. It's a big part of why so many people who've lost weight just can't keep it off. However, Research suggests some nutrients have a higher tendency to store more bodyfat than others, even when calories are equated. The kinds of food that show the biggest tendency to store fat appear to be saturated fats, added fructose, trans fat, and food cooked in deep fried oils. Oils cooked at high temperature for long periods tend to increase their saturated fat and trans fat content. It's also a good idea to opt for unrefined carbohydrates.

I will say that saturated fats on a ketogenic diet may not cause the same degree of body fat increase, due to keto's nature of metabolizing more fat than normal. The harm more so applies to saturated fats on diets that are also carb rich.

Here's all the research I've gathered:

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561422002941](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261561422002941)

**Longitudinal association of dietary carbohydrate quality with visceral fat deposition and other adiposity indicators**

>Results After controlling for potential confounding factors, a 3-point increment in CQI over 12-month follow-up was associated with a decrease in visceral fat (Œ≤ ‚àí0.067 z-score, 95% CI -0.088; ‚àí0.046, p < 0.001), android-to-gynoid fat ratio (‚àí0.038, ‚àí0.059; ‚àí0.017, p < 0.001), and total fat (‚àí0.064, ‚àí0.080; ‚àí0.047, p < 0.001). Fibre intake and the ratio of wholegrain/total grain showed the strongest inverse associations with all adiposity indicators.

>Conclusions In this prospective cohort of older adults with overweight/obesity and MetS, we found that improvements in dietary carbohydrate quality over a year were associated with concurrent favorable changes in visceral and overall fat deposition. These associations were mostly driven by dietary fibre and the wholegrain/total grain ratio.

**Overfeeding polyunsaturated and saturated fat causes distinct effects on liver and visceral fat accumulation in humans**

>Both groups gained similar weight. SFA (satyrated fatty acids) however, markedly increased liver fat compared with PUFAs (polyunsatured fatty acids);and caused a twofold larger increase in VAT (visceral fat) than PUFAs. Conversely, PUFAs caused a nearly threefold larger increase in lean tissue than SFAs. Increase in liver fat directly correlated with changes in plasma SFAs and inversely with PUFAs. Genes involved in regulating energy dissipation, insulin resistance, body composition, and fat-cell differentiation in SAT were differentially regulated between diets, and associated with increased PUFAs in SAT. In conclusion, overeating SFAs promotes hepatic and visceral fat storage, whereas excess energy from PUFAs may instead promote lean tissue in healthy humans.

**Deep-frying impact on food and oil chemical composition: Strategies to reduce oil absorption in the final product**

>The authors observed an increase in SFA content (from 13.6% to 21.6%) mainly of lauric (C12:0), myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0), stearic (C18:0), and arachidic (C20:0). At the same time, there was a decrease in unsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid (OA; C18:1), linoleic acid (LA; C18:2 n‚Äì3) and ALA from 80.8% to 71.2% from the first to the sixth cycle. Moreover, the TFA content progressively increased (from 1.1% to 6.5%) (Sohu et al., 2020). These studies indicate that repetitive frying deteriorates the oil's fatty acid profile toward a higher content of SFA and TFA to the detriment of MUFA and PUFA (Cui et al., 2017; Flores et al., 2018; Sohu et al., 2020).

**Common questions and misconceptions about protein supplementation: what does the scientific evidence really show?**

>A follow-up study compared two different dietary protein intakes (i.e. 2.3 vs. 3.4‚Äâg/kg/d) in resistance-trained males and females who underwent a traditional bodybuilding training program \[Citation64\]. Both groups experienced a similar increase in lean body mass; however, the higher-protein group (3.4‚Äâg/kg/d) experienced a greater reduction in fat mass. Furthermore, in an 8-week crossover study in resistance-trained males \[Citation28\], a high-protein group consumed significantly more protein (3.3‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ0.8‚Äâg/kg/day) and calories than the control group (2.6‚Äâ¬±‚Äâ1.0‚Äâg/kg/day), yet there was no change in fat mass. These studies dispute the notion that excess energy from protein alone promotes gains in fat mass; however, diets high in fats and/or carbohydrates and low in protein tend to promote greater increases in fat mass as well as body mass \[Citation66‚Äì70\].

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916523188642](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0002916523188642)

**Fat and carbohydrate overfeeding in humans: different effects on energy storage**

>Carbohydrate overfeeding produced progressive increases in carbohydrate oxidation and total energy expenditure resulting in 75-85% of excess energy being stored. Alternatively, fat overfeeding had minimal effects on fat oxidation and total energy expenditure, leading to storage of 90-95% of excess energy. Excess dietary fat leads to greater fat accumulation than does excess dietary carbohydrate, and the difference was greatest early in the overfeeding period.

**Conversion of Sugar to Fat: Is Hepatic de Novo Lipogenesis Leading to Metabolic Syndrome and Associated Chronic Diseases?**

>Likewise, in the fed state, de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is also determined by the type of simple sugar consumed. Fructose, but not glucose, increased hepatic DNL in 6 healthy lean parti-cipants (Figure 3). During 6 hours of fructose inges-tion, DNL increased 20-fold, and 25% of circulating VLDL-TG was derived from DNL. In contrast, when the study was repeated in the same participants using glucose levels, rates of DNL were unaffected, and only 1% to 2% of VLDL-TG was synthesized de novo.

10:00 AM- An orange as a snack

12:00 PM- Two pieces of ham, two pieces of cheese, an apple, and raisins for lunch

5:00 PM- Five cut up pieces of a filet, raisins, and an orange for dinner

On days that I work, I can only get in breakfast and lunch in. I'll usually have filet for lunch instead when that happens, even though thats usually what I have for dinner.

I've been dairy-free way longer as it's always upset my stomach. Through my pregnancy I stayed vegan despite intense daily meat cravings. I've been breastfeeding for 5 months now, still strictly vegan, and I'm having cravings again. My diet consists of whole foods. Oatmeal, tofu, chickpeas, nuts, fruits and veggies are all I eat. I eat plenty of calories to sustain myself and my milk supply. 

Despite all of this, I'm just so exhausted and I feel like I lack all vitality. I don't feel like I look healthy even though I eat so ""clean."" I take b12 and prenatals, exercise, stay hydrated, get good sleep and I'm so happy in motherhood, so why do I feel so bleh? Could it be the lack of animal food sources?

I lift 4-6x a week, but due to the 50 lb cut, I'd still consider myself weak and a gym beginner (I don't think I can bench more than 180 lbs these days, even though at my heaviest I hit 240 lbs). I guess that means I'd have a higher propensity to grow, you know with newbie gains and muscle memory.

Every estimate I try to get is all over the place. Some people say go hard and eat in a big 500-calorie surplus. Some people say go for a 200 surplus. Some people say to select sedentary when you use online TDEE calculators because unless you ""work a physically demanding job, you're sedentary"". The latter puts my maintenance at 2,000 calories which feels crazy low, that's how much I'm eating right now and I feel like shit most days. On the other hand, some people say that with my activity, I should be eating close to 3,000 calories if I want to gain weight.

I know the best thing to do is trial and error, but with so many estimates all over the place that would take a while. Do you guys have any advice for me and how much I should be eating? And what kind of macros I should be thinking about? Currently, I'm working with the assumption that on a lean, 200 calorie surplus I should be eating 2,200 calories assuming I'm not supposed to factor in activity level.

I also estimate myself to be about 15% body fat (photos attached), which seems to reduce the calculator's estimate by hundreds of calories. Do I factor that in? Is it supposed to affect it so much? I'm incredibly confused.

Any guidance would be appreciated, thank you!",1,7,1744262596.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1jvqd93/18m_im_61_and_143_pounds_and_im_not_sure_how_much/

Lactase persistence gene Sources: cheese,yogurt,milk,kefir,skyr

One change is that a few years ago I went veggie, this is fine,.but recently I read about the 0.8g protein for kg body weight and realised I'm way below. With the HIT I do I figured it's time to increase protein. I don't eat to feeling bloated, I feel I eat normal portions and aren't ""finishing my plate"".

To get the protein 68g. I eat typically per day:

4 eggs, 2-4 glasses semi skimmed milk, 1 cup mixed nuts, 100-120g cottage cheese.

On top of this, I have maybe 4 slices bread with butter (not lathered on, quite sparing),  normal evening meal (healthy).

* Ultimately, I hope this research will help to challenge the way eating disorders are typically portrayed (often as a ""White, Western"" issue) and provide a more nuanced understanding that could lead to better diagnosis, support, and culturally competent care for minority girls
* All respondents would be 100% anonymous to ensure safety and to encourage more honest responses
* Once completed I will share out numerical summaries of data upon request

All findings I hope to give to treatment centers so they can create more culturally competent care.¬†

1jta48i,diet,Calcium Craze: üåü  Superfoods for Stronger Bones and Better Health,"Calcium is essential for maintaining strong bones and teeth, muscle function, and overall health. Here are some fantastic calcium-rich foods to include in your daily diet:



ü•õ¬†**Dairy Products**: Milk, cheese, and yogurt are classic calcium sources. Enjoy a glass of milk with breakfast or a piece of cheese as a snack!

ü•¶¬†**Broccoli**: This green powerhouse not only provides calcium but also offers a host of other essential vitamins and minerals. Steam it or add it to salads for a nutritious boost.

üßä¬†**Tofu**: A versatile and plant-based source of calcium, perfect for vegetarians and vegans. Add tofu to your stir-fries or salads.

üêü¬†**Canned Fish with Bones**: Sardines and salmon are excellent sources of calcium, especially when you consume the bones. Enjoy them in sandwiches, salads, or as a snack.

üå±¬†**Sesame Seeds**: These tiny seeds pack a powerful calcium punch. Sprinkle them on salads, smoothies, or baked goods for an extra boost.

ü•ú¬†**Almonds**: A healthy snack option that provides calcium along with healthy fats. Grab a handful for an afternoon pick-me-up.

  


# For Best Results:

üïí¬†**Time of Day**: Spread out your calcium intake throughout the day for optimal absorption. Include calcium-rich foods in your breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

üåû¬†**Pair with Vitamin D**: Enhance calcium absorption by pairing it with vitamin D-rich foods like fatty fish or fortified cereals.

# What to Avoid:

üö´¬†**High Caffeine**: Excessive caffeine can interfere with calcium absorption.

üö´¬†**Alcohol**: Limit alcohol consumption, as it can negatively impact calcium levels.

üö´¬†**Excessive Salt**: High salt intake can cause calcium loss through urine. Keep your salt consumption in check.

   * **Salmon**: Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory effects that may help reduce acne-related inflammation.
   * **Quinoa**: A gluten-free grain with high levels of protein and magnesium, which help with skin regeneration.
   * **Asparagus**: Contains vitamins A, C, and E, promoting skin health and healing.

# Evening:

* **Herbal Tea (Chamomile or Lavender)** Chamomile and lavender tea have soothing properties that can help with overall relaxation and stress reduction, which may also aid in reducing acne flare-ups due to stress.

1jqt9w5,diet,Rant. I sometimes hate myself so much.,"
Long story short otherwise no one will read it. 

Years ago ended up in the hospital with an arrhythmia episode. Got diagnosed with afib. They told me to lose weight. This was in 2021. That motivated me to lose weight. I basically started starving myself. Severely restricting my calories. Not healthy, but it worked. Dropped down from 120kg to 107kg in about three months. That‚Äôs when I hit a plateau and lost motivation. Got through it. Now sitting at 95kg. Have been for a year. Lost all motivation. My goal was 80kg. But I was okay with 95. I was just done. Got the flue a while back which saw me drop down to 92kg but I ate that all back in candy bars. 

Today I wanted to know how much sugar I consumed. Because I felt like it was a lot. I wrote down everything I ate and calculated it. Of the 60g I am allowed to eat daily, I ate 154g. In one fucking day. Totalling to 2.807 calories. Of the 2.500 I‚Äôm allowed to have. No exercise either of course. Just sat on my ass all day playing games. My ‚Äúexercise‚Äù usually amounts to a walk. Nothing more. About 10.000 steps nothing more. No wonder I‚Äôm not losing anything. I am a joke and I hate myself sometimes. I am afraid of getting diabetes. I feel like this isn‚Äôt the only day I‚Äôve eaten this much sugar lately. I am ashamed to be me right now. This will never fucking happen again.

I just threw out all the candy I had left. This will NEVER happen again and I will reach 80kg dammit. Just hope I‚Äôm not diabetic already. Genuinely scared of that rn.

My symptoms are mainly: slight tremors, slight hungry and slight weakness. Just snaking some cherry tomatoes or a carrot is enough to stop the symptoms.



I already tried to change what I eat but it changes nothing.



Also, I don't have this problem if I'm not active.



My lunch is white cheese with oeats and frozen raspberries + a bit of cocoa (no sugar) and peanuts butter.



I tried to change it for some vegetables + eggs or mackerel and oats/frozen raspberries/cocoa/pb.



does it come from what I eat ? the quantities ? Maybe a particular ingredient ?

I wanted to ask you since I'm pretty new in the calorie counting Community.  
I researched my base Calorie usage but got 2 very different results.  
On the first one I got maintain calories of around 3k and a deficit recommended of 2600 Calories  
On the second calculator, I got 2500 to maintain and 2000 for a deficit.  
I'm Male 19 180¬†cm and 76¬†kg and still in school I train 4‚Äì5 times a week for a total of around 14h a week with the most being Badminton with an average Heart rate of 130  
I got an estimated Body fat of around 30%   
Now my question since I exercise around 5 times a week how should I calculate that into my deficit?  
Each day different on how many calories I burn, or take the median and use that number every day?   
Another question is on how much I can trust my watch with the calories' calculation. Because when I train Badminton for 4h with an average BPM of 130 and peak 160 I get 1550 kcal and 1969 kcal with passive calories added. Since my daily intake is around 2k I feel like It's too little for the day, but when I have a rest day I feel like that I didn't burn any calories. 

  
Summarized:

How can I calculate my Calories right?  
Which number should I use?  
Should I eat different amounts of Calories when I train or not?  
And can I just add the given number from my watch to the Calorie counter as allowance to refill these burned calories?

1jp1onx,diet,Need advice on diet change to loose weight,"I have been trying to loose some weight now for a couple of years but my weight just stays stable no matter what.  
I measure around the stomach and the measurements are not going down either.

I eat once a day and around 600-700kcal a day and drink 2-3 liters of water each day.  
Sometimes I have gone two days in a row without eating when I know that I have eaten too much (for example eating a pizza on a Saturday with friends).

I hate seeing myself in the bathroom mirror and I can't seem to loose weight.  
My general rule is ""If I can't weigh it then I don't eat it"" and use a kitchen scale for all my meals.

A dinner for me could look like this:

**Chicken breast fillet (200g, marinated)**:

* Chicken itself: Approximately **370‚Äì390 kcal**.
* Marinade (75g): package data, **69 kcal √ó 0.75 = 51.75 kcal**.

Total for the marinated chicken fillet: **421.75‚Äì441.75 kcal**.

**Uncooked rice (50g)**:

* Roughly **170 kcal**.

**Veggies (salad, cucumber, paprika, red onion)**:

* Lettuce mix (100g): **20 kcal**.
* Cucumber (50g): **8 kcal**.
* Paprika (50g): **15 kcal**.
* Red onion (25g): **11 kcal**.

Total for veggies: **54 kcal**.

  
My stats are:  
Gender - Male  
Height - 182cm  
Weight - 119kg  
Age - 31

My workout consist of walking atleast 10 000 steps a day.  
4 times a week I go out for walks that are around 25 000 steps in total.

I have purchased a bicycle and intend to go out for 3 hours rides around 3-4 times a week and also take the bike to work and to the store.  
I spend 3 times a week doing weight lifting at home for around 1 hours and 30 minutes.

I have done bloodtests and all my vitamin values are okay and cortisol value is within normal range.  
A month ago I saw a dietist who just laughed and said it was outside her expertise to help me so that didn't give me anything.

I'm a 32 YO male  177cm 62kg - I've been working out for a few years and always had a stubborn fat around my waist/belly, and a few weeks ago I decided for good to get rid of it.

I've been eating:  
  
500g chicken breast, airfried (550 kcal)  
400g boiled potato and then airfried (500 kcal, I purchase it pre-made and it as a few other ingredients)  
1 or 2 whey protein shake (with water, 250 kcal)   
1 piece of chocolate (140 kcal)  
  
I end up consuming roughly 1400 - 1700kcal per day (some days I eat a snack or something), but I've been following this religiously. I have no trouble whatsoever eating repetitively.

Some days I wake up feeling well, others a bit fatigued, but I'm honestly feeling good 80% of the time.   
  
I have lost some fat already, my strength is increasing at the gym (I'm working out 4 - 5 times per week) and my mood has never been better. Everyday I wake up feeling refreshed, in a good mood and most of the days I wake up from pretty pleasant dreams.

With that being said, I'm just concerned whether this is sustainable in the long run in terms of vitamins and minerals - i am not consuming much from foods. 

I only take one vitamin for my hair (idk what is in it exactly), and I have purchased a multivitamin + vitamin D + vitamin C to supplement the diet. Would it be enough or should I change my diet to make it sustainable in the long run?

1jnfl0i,diet,Need help for mold detox diet,"Long story short, I spent weeks with an intense allergic reaction that resulted being in different hospitals for a week with no doctor being able to explain why. Later found out I was living with black mold for years which probably explained why I was always sick, started having major gut issues, and so many other symptoms.

Found a doctor who finally made me feel like I was being heard and all of my blood work points to mold toxicity. While I wait for the actual testing to see the severity, they want me to start changing my diet.

First point for avoid is sugar in all forms. I want to be strict at home because I eat out more than a normal person, and I don't want to worry as much. I think it's just going to be hard because I'm a big fruit/dried fruit and cheese snacker. I also have never been gluten free. When I was on a diet while losing major lbs, I mostly snacked on carrots, but I'm honestly a little tired of it. 

I'm supposed to be on this for at least six months before they retest, but if anyone can help me with ideas so its sustainable, greatly appreciated. I tend to be disciplined, but I'm already just having feelings of frustration with the new restrictions.

I have been invited for a meeting to start working with an underwear company and they want to take my exact measurements in 4 days.
My measurements meet their requirements, but i want to make them a bit better until the meeting. 
I know its super unrealistic especially with 4 days in my hand, but does anyone have any advice on how to look your best in such a short and urgent time? 

I bloat really easily and want to know if theres a way to make my stomach less bloated for the meeting and just how to present myself in the best way possible.

1jku12y,diet,Stupid question about eggs.,"Hello! For context, I live in a third world country where protein is expensive and protein powder even more. Eggs, however, are the cheapest source of protein next to grains that can be found. The thing is, I absolutely loathe eggs, I can't stand them in nearly any shape or form. So, I was wondering if there is any way to consume them in like a medicine type way. A friend suggested just swallowing a whole poached egg like a pill, and I considered just chugging them raw or making hard boiled or scrambled eggs and chopping them into tiny pieces and just drop them into a glass of water and chug that without chewing. I wonder if there is anyone here with a similar problem that came up with a fun solution like that, and also just general info on if that's gonna hurt absorption in any way or something like that. For reference, I'm a 180cm 78kg young man, go to the gym the five days of the week and take creatine on the daily. Also, I'm not gonna replace all protein for this method, I still like to eat meat and do most days of the week, but I'd like to find a way to get some even on the days where I can't eat meat or to compliment those where I can. Basically, be my homemade protein powder, in a way. Thank you!

1jjgwy1,diet,how is a chicken salad milk egg diet,"so ill be joining college soon and will be cooking my own food , i was thinking to start a completely new diet because ill be not staying with my family .

my family's diet was very carb heavy , basically rice and wheat everyday with some vegetables

  
now  that im going to college this is how my diet is going to be like ; loads of salads mostly lettuce, cucumber,carrots,tomatoes and sometimes ill also throw in some kelp or spinach and whatever green stuff i find in my grocery

with that ill throw in a chicken breast cooked in a pan with some olive oil , lemon and some salt for taste

then 2-3 cups of full fat milk throughout the day once in morning and night 

ill always try to put in eggs in my breakfast but i dont know how it will be as who really has time for breakfast in college 

ill add some fruits and yoghurt too whenever i find the time 

so yeah thats pretty much it ,also a ton of water, the reason im going ahead with this diet is because it super simple quick, reallly healthy and im not the best hand at cooking.

ill also be eating from outside from time to time but i will try to limit it

any suggestions , maybe something there is that i should add. 

i will probably be taking protein and creatine too

1jj3rib,diet,How to consistently eat healthy when you feel malnourished?,"Hi everyone,

I'm an on & off healthy eater. I go through stages of eating incredibly well, then backing off and being unhealthy for a while before I get tired of feeling horrible (and regaining IBS) and decide to get back to healthy eating. My problem is staying consistent, sure, because fruit and veggies go bad faster than junk, but most prominently if I eat too healthy my body asks me to dial it back.

To elaborate, when I eat healthy, I eat very healthy. %100 whole rolled oats for breakfast, raw honey, granola, egg whites, just bare chicken w/ salad, lean meats with more vegetables / fruits for dinner. I love green / red / romaine lettuce, carrots, apples, cucumbers, oranges, greek yogurt, yellow corn popcorn, beans, potatoes, etc. And I'll feel unbelievably good, like a strong positive feeling in my stomach and no IBS good.

The problem is if I do that for a little while, my body feels super malnourished. Like nothing can satisfy it unless I get a juicy burger at IN-N-OUT or a hot dog from portillos, and I have to do that a couple of times to feel back to normal. But if I do that, then I forget to eat healthy and it all goes out the window.

So my question, **my TLDR**, is that when I eat too healthy, I feel very malnourished. Is it because I'm missing something in my diet, or is it my body's way of tricking me into eating unhealthy again? How can I overcome this?",1,7,1742854838.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1jj3rib/how_to_consistently_eat_healthy_when_you_feel/

Somehow, despite this extreme diet, he's been gaining weight and now has a chubby belly, and he doesn't know what to improve in his diet to lose weight.

I eat 3 times as much as my partner, but I manage to lose weight. A couple months ago I was at 52kg which was my ideal weight really, but I was also on antidepressants. I halved my medication and gone back down to 49kg, which was my standard weight before the medication even though I'd prefer to be on 52kg.

>"" Results: intrahepatic lipid (IHL) content was significantly lower (-28%) after the two-week low-Glycemic index (GI)/Saturated fatty acid (SFA) diet (2.4 ¬± 0.5% 95% CI [1.4, 3.4]) than after the two-week high-GI/SFA diet (3.3 ¬± 0.6% 95% CI [1.9, 4.7], p < 0.05). Although hepatic glycogen content, hepatic de novo lipogenesis, hepatic lipid composition, and substrate oxidation during the night were similar between the two diets, the glycemic response to the low-GI/SFA diet was reduced (p < 0.05).

>Conclusions: Changes in macronutrient quality can already have drastic effects on liver fat content and postprandial glycemia after two weeks and even when energy content and the percentage of total fat and carbohydrate remains unchanged.""

And then here's a good meta-analysis directly comparing the ""dreaded seed oils"" to saturated fats:

https://digil.ink/s/d1d8f331-6cbe-4c73-a1b5-7638369f2df0

Even the anti-inflammatory argument doesn't work as saturated fats are found to be the most inflammatory nutrients across many studies, while omega-6s, which is what most seed oils are comprised of, are actually found to be anti inflammatory.

The one single argument against seed oils is that deep frying seed oils causes them to oxidize into harmful compounds such as aldehydes and acrylimydes, while saturated fats are more stable and less prone to oxidation.

I'm starting to work out but the problem is I don't know what to eat. I know I am pretty healthy weight-wise which I am grateful for as I should be much heavier. The main thing is my choice of foods, I'm homeschooled so I have a lot of free time which is mostly spent at the Dairy Queen where I work. I am living off of food from Circle K like instant ramen, mac n cheese, rice-a-roni, etc, the main thing is the ice cream. While at home I snack on any chips, crackers, and sweet treats, as well as some more ramen and any frozen junk food. I go between eating non-stop to eating once a day pretty often but I am trying to get on a regular eating schedule with healthy foods. I don't know what kind of diet would suit me best but I see a lot of people talking about calorie-deficit diets so I was gonna try that. When I search for what to eat this is the first thing that pops up.

Protein-Rich Foods:¬†

* **Lean meats:**¬†Chicken, turkey, fish (low-fat options)
* **Eggs:**¬†High in protein and low in calories
* **Greek yogurt:**¬†Provides protein and probiotics for gut health¬†

Fiber-Rich Foods:¬†

* **Whole grains:**¬†Brown rice, quinoa, oatmeal
* **Fruits:**¬†Apples, berries, bananas
* **Vegetables:**¬†Broccoli, cauliflower, carrots¬†

Healthy Fats:¬†

Other Calorie-Deficit Friendly Foods:

* **Water:**¬†Staying hydrated can help suppress appetite.
* **Herbal teas:**¬†Green tea, black tea, and rooibos can promote metabolism.
* **Spicy foods:**¬†Capsaicin in chili peppers may boost calorie burn.¬†

Examples of Meal Combinations:

* **Breakfast:**¬†Oatmeal with berries and nuts, Greek yogurt with fruit and granola¬†

* **Dinner:**¬†Salmon with roasted vegetables, brown rice and a small portion of lean meat¬†
* **Snacks:**¬†Almonds, apple slices, carrot sticks¬†

1jgkmy0,diet,Scale is the same but measurements shrunk,"So i have been stuck at 200 pounds for a few weeks and the scale wont budge. But i measured my waist and hips and both are down like an inch. So even though the scale is the same, my body is changing. I am so glad i started taking measurements. Otherwise i would feel like a total failure right now.

I do calorie counting using Meal AI cause i hate manual logging. I just snap a photo and see the approximate cals. I have been pretty consistent at around 1700 cals a day plus i go on a 30 minute walk daily. I also started doing some simple dumbbell exercises at home, maybe that is causing some body recomposition so the scale is not moving but i am losing inches.

It is definitely frustrating to see the same number on the scale, but i keep telling myself this is not just about weight, it is about losing fat. My clothes feel looser, my face looks a bit slimmer, and i see muscle definition in my arms. That is progress too. If i had only focused on the scale, i might have given up.

Anyway i wanted to share because i am sure many folks go through the same frustration. Sometimes your body holds onto water or you gain a bit of muscle or the scale just refuses to move for no reason. Keep measuring, keep noticing non scale victories, and do not quit.

Lunch- Daal with rice

Dinner - Whatever is cooked maybe curry with rice and that's it.

1jfeqiy,diet,Struggles with My Current Diet,"Last week, I weighed 390 lbs, and over the past week, I have been seeing a nutritionist, though it wasn‚Äôt entirely by choice. As part of this change, my portion sizes have been restricted for the last six days, and as of today, I weigh 376.7 lbs, meaning I have lost 13.3 lbs in about a week.

However, this transition has been extremely difficult. The nutritionist prepares Armenian dishes, some of which I find decent like borsht, but others are completely unpalatable. I‚Äôve always struggled with cooked vegetables, especially when they are soggy or mushy, and unfortunately, many of the meals I‚Äôve been given fall into that category. One dish, in particular, used eggplant as the base, with a liquidized mixture of eggplant, meat, and other cooked vegetables. The texture alone made it nearly impossible for me to eat.

Beyond the food itself, I feel immense stress from this entire situation. I don‚Äôt enjoy eating anymore, and it‚Äôs becoming mentally exhausting. Most of my weight loss seems to come from not finishing meals or skipping food altogether, which doesn‚Äôt feel like a healthy or sustainable way to lose weight.

At this point, I‚Äôm seriously considering quitting this diet plan and making my own pre-made meals for the week. My idea is to prepare meals with a balanced mix of one-third carbs, one-third meat, and one-third raw vegetables‚Äîsince I tolerate those much better than cooked ones. However, I‚Äôm not sure if I can do it properly or if it will be effective.

Ultimately, my goal is to reach 200 lbs, but I need a plan that I can stick to long-term without feeling miserable.

Also there is some life style changes as well such as sleeping at 11 PM to wake up at 7 AM, and walking a min of 10000-15000 steps a day which is a massive change from before where i stayed up late and was a couch potato at home which i didnt mind having changed.",2,5,1742437636.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1jfeqiy/struggles_with_my_current_diet/

However I want to know if my body is getting thr correct nutrients it needs daily or if this monotrphic type style.of eating is unhealthy for long term. I do take a daily multivitamin to help offset any defffeciancies but anyone with more knowledge on this I would love to know there advice.

1jf56pr,diet,Need Advice on Low-Carb Weight Loss + Fasting & Caloric Deficit,"I‚Äôm looking for advice on losing weight while following a low-carb diet, incorporating intermittent fasting, and maintaining a caloric deficit. I‚Äôm also planning to start lifting again to preserve muscle.

I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô8‚Äù male, currently 230 lbs, and my goal weight is at least 180 lbs. I know I need to be in a deficit, but I‚Äôm not sure what my calorie intake should be or how much protein I should aim for to maintain muscle while cutting.

Based on some online calculators, my estimated caloric intake for fat loss should be around 1,800 - 2,000 calories/day, with about 180g of protein (aiming for ~1g per pound of goal body weight). Does this sound right? Should I adjust based on lifting and fasting?

1jf3r3l,diet,appetite too small to eat enough - need help,"that's basically it. 5'3, 120-124 lbs (havent checked in a while bc my scale's broken), and i can't eat over 1k calories on a good day. now, i'm medically healthy, so clearly i'm doing something right, but i still get the feeling less than 1k is objectively not enough no matter what. 
the issue is: my appetite has always been small. my eyes are bigger than my stomach, but i can't even finish a whole cheeseburger if i have a drink with it (even water). i only get hungry maybe twice a day, and now that i'm on vyvanse for ADHD, i only get hungry once a day after dinnertime on the days i take it. 
there are rare days where i can actually eat normally (i finished an entire caniac combo a few months ago!!) but those are rare. 
i've been trying to at the very least make my 1-2 meals a day high in calories, but i just don't have the stomach. protein shakes are great, but they make me full and the only ones i actually like are 160 calories. 
i don't know what to do. all i know is i would be THRIVING in an apocalyptic setting bc of this. has anyone else had this? how can i eat enough without making myself want to puke? i swear to god my stomach might be the size of a golf ball with how little i can eat",2,3,1742408310.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1jf3r3l/appetite_too_small_to_eat_enough_need_help/

1jdme6t,diet,I would appreciate some advice.,"Hey, thanks for reading.

So I weigh quite a bit, (400+) and I'm working on it. I'm using the myfitnesspal app to keep track of everything. According to my height, weight, sex, relative activity and age, I have a maintenance intake of 3400 calories. And the app recommends 2900 cal intake daily for a 1-2lb weekly loss. 

I took a more heavy handed approach, in the belief that I wanted to be able to change my habits now for the sake of being able to maintain it after the weightloss. So I decided i would personally limit myself to about 1800 cal a day, as that amount should sustain my goal weight after the fact. 

Now my question is despite maintaining this, in general, and in fact maintaining an average of about 1500 calories a day since mid january, why have I not lost any weight for the past two weeks. 

I know loss isn't always instant, and I have already seen some solid results (approx 25lbs down since i began). but I'm still at an extreme enough weight that I don't get how I would be stalling so soon.

Now I am meal prepping 90% of my meals. using a gram scale, and the myfitnesspal app to know as close to my actual intake as physically possible. I am as certain in my intake as I think any person can reasonably be. So if anyone could tell me how I could not be losing despite this level of caloric deficit, I would really appreciate it.",1,7,1742242097.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1jdme6t/i_would_appreciate_some_advice/

1jdgzbo,diet,"In a deficit, not losing any weight or inches","Male, 5'9"", 190 pounds 48 years old

I've been trying for some time to get leaner - I've been into fitness for years, and I don't feel like the time I've spent is reflected in my body composition. I track my macros, lift 4 days a week and since the turn of the year I've been doing at least 30 minutes of zone 2/zone 3 cardio daily. I've seen my PCP and had bloodwork done. I even broke down and bought a Fitbit so I could have a better understanding of the energy I'm burning each day.

Since I've been tracking and believed that I was in a deficit for quite some time, for the month of December I upped my calories to 2600 and ended up adding a couple of pounds.

Starting in January daily intake goal moved down to 2238 kcal with my macro goals are 160P, 260C, 62F. Below is some information that I've been able to pull from my tracking:

|Week Of|Average Consumed|Average Burned|
|:-|:-|:-|
||
|Feb 1|1,956.57|3,127.00|
|Feb 8|2,260.57|3,062.29|
|Feb 15|1,930.14|3,052.86|
|Feb 22|2,130.71|3,193.00|
|Mar 1|2,132.71|3,049.14|
|Mar 8|2,285.83|3,221.33|

I understand that the burned energy data I'm getting from my Fitbit can have some margins for error, and that nothing outside of lab testing would be completely accurate. However, I believe that the above reflects that I am in a deficit, but neither the scale nor my body comp has changed. I'm already at about a thousand calorie deficit and I'm concerned going much lower would start to hurt my lean mass. I am not sure what my next course of action should be.",1,13,1742229207.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1jdgzbo/in_a_deficit_not_losing_any_weight_or_inches/

Although often after 3-5 bites I feel full with the sugar craving but I just try to complete the whole of what I ordered say a cake of 2 serving I will complete it , a cookie packet whose serving size if 2 cookies but I will still complete it giving myself the reasoning in mind its not that much of sugar high which I want.

But lately I started just taking 3-4 sips of a natural citrus fruit juice say orange which doesnt have any added sugar and I am coming with the observation that its the enough sugar high which I need on my tastebuds.

So , like is it some undergoing uncovered condition I am facing where I need something which satisfy my tastebuds and if not I keep eating to get the high although knowing its not good for my diet/health

I figured okay let me take my diet and exercise more seriously, might as well try to put on some muscle while I‚Äôm at it. Well let me tell ya, trying to meet my nutritional goals within the boundaries of a lowish glycemic diet has been a struggle. 

Surprisingly I have been doing very good at cutting out the sugar, I‚Äôm often under 50-60% of my recommendation and almost all of that is coming from apples, strawberries, etc. not soda, ice cream, or candy.

Where I have been struggling is calories, carbohydrates, and to some extent fat. My calories have been 400-500 low per day (a few quizzes showed I should be around 2400 calories), my carbs have been far too low (recommended around 300g, usually around 140-220g), and my fats have been a bit high (should be around 80g but have been 90-115g, a lot coming from nuts). 

Unfortunately I am kind of a picky eater. I don‚Äôt really care for beans and I have been struggling to find a rice that isn‚Äôt too bad GI wise that I like. Chickpea and whole wheat pasta seem fairly good but a bit concerned about the blood sugar impact there and how much I can consume at a time.

1jbm6sn,diet,Nutrition guidance for fat loss while building muscle.,"I‚Äôm a 16 year old 275lbs 6‚Äô2‚Äù lineman currently in my offseason. I got about 5 months until we start practicing and playing games and my goal is to loose as much weight as possible while maintaining if not gaining (really preferably gaining) muscle.

I don‚Äôt have much time to waste so I really want to make sure my diet plan is sound. 4 days a week I lift for an hour, another 4 days a week I run ~4.5km in 40mins. Typically my Apple Watch will record ~1500cal burned doing both. 

Using calculator.net, to maintain my body weight without working out I would need to eat 2800cal. To loose 2lbs a week I would need to eat about 1800cal. Giving myself 5000 (1250x4) extra cal a week for exercise puts me at around 2500cal per day which I usually try to get 2000cal-2500cal since bigger fellas like me can generally loose more fast quicker safely.

In addition to dieting, I also fast a 20:4 schedule, generally eating one meal a day at about 8 PM and exercising on an empty stomach and going to sleep after eating my protein. I do this to try and accelerate ketosis and the burning of fat cells. As for macros I aim to get 200g of protein (usually make it to 150g), 180g of carbs, and 75g of fats. 

I‚Äôve been doing this for about 2 weeks consistently, haven‚Äôt noticed much of a different yet. Is this a realistic and good plan? Will I loose a good amount weight while maintaining muscle? Will I build muscle? Any help is appreciated! üôè",1,1,1742009216.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1jbm6sn/nutrition_guidance_for_fat_loss_while_building/

I am a 22F, currently weight 52.05kg and I‚Äôm 175cm tall.
My goal is body recomp, as I want to get toned, losing fat and gaining muscle.

My TDEE is around 1600cal, so I‚Äôm in a slight deficit, eating 1300cal on the days in which I weight train and 1000cal on my rest days.

I am quite confused because these days my weight has been constantly increasing. Monday I weighted 51.30kg and today (Thursday) I weight 52.05kg. I track my calories very accurately so I‚Äôm 100% sure I was within my 1300cal limit.

I‚Äôm trying to think of the reasons why I might be gaining weight, and the only thing I can think about is the fact that since Monday I have been eating a lot more protein, as I started assuming protein powder (yes I count the calories of the protein powder). That means that if without it I was getting around 60-70g, this whole week I‚Äôve managed to always get at least 90g.
Is it possible that the protein powder is making me gain weight, even if I‚Äôm still in a calorie deficit?

Another thing I‚Äôm going to mention is that I usually weight train 5 times a week (being doing it since a bit more than 1 month), but last week was really rough on my mental health, so I ended up not working out at all, and also eating 700cal per day (max 40g of protein). Did that from Monday to Friday, then I ate 1000cal on Saturday and 1300cal again on Sunday.
This week I still managed to improve on every exercise, compared to 2 weeks ago, even with the week of break (although I‚Äôm super sore lol).

1j9ezsh,diet,Immense fatigue after eating anything at lunch or in the afternoon,"About me:

* I'm in my 30s and I'm very healthy and active. I do a lot of sport, I spend time outside, etc.
* I do an annual check-up and every single time the results are the same: I'm as healthy as one can be.
* I work from home.
* I sleep between 6:30 and 7 hours at night.
* My diet: protein smoothie in the morning, oatmeal and fruit for lunch, protein bar in the afternoon and then a regular-size dinner that's always different (burger, ramen, pasta, etc.).
* I drink three coffees a day, always at the same time: morning, after lunch, afternoon.

My problem is that every day after lunch and until maybe the late afternoon, I get sleepy to the point where I'm sometimes useless. Like entirely useless. If I close my eyes, I could fall asleep in maybe 10 seconds - THAT sleepy.

But for the first time in my life, I feel like I‚Äôve actually cracked the code to sustainable weight loss.

The biggest change? I stopped aiming for perfection. Instead of cutting out entire food groups or starving myself, I started:  
\* Eating mostly whole foods but allowing myself occasional treats (without guilt).  
\* Focusing on protein and fiber to stay full instead of obsessing over calories.  
\* Walking **8-10k steps daily** instead of forcing myself into workouts I hate.  
\* Drinking **3L of water a day** (turns out I was just thirsty half the time).  
\* Actually *sleeping* (getting **7-8 hours** changed everything).

1j94fa4,diet,how many calories are actually in Wio foods??,"I made a post asking this before: 

I have been buying these products from a place called WIO foods, and I‚Äôm confused about the calorie count of their products.
On the back of the product, the label says one thing (for instance in the picture I included of their peanut butter, it says 31 calories per serving), but then on another part of the label in smaller print it says amount per serving: calories 200.
So, which is it? is it 200 calories per serving or 31?

Some people replied to my post and said that most of the calories seem to come from indigestible foods so therefore they don‚Äôt count because they will not be absorbed by the body and will just pass through as waste, and the one that says 200 is the calories it would be without the added indigestible stuff.  

That makes sense, but I noticed after eating these for a few days and counting my calories (staying within my daily limit that I‚Äôm using to loose weight- so under my maintenance), that I gained about 5 pounds. So i‚Äôm confused, if I should really be counting by the lower label then why would I be gaining weight? 
For instance, their muffins are about 40 calories each, when a regular muffin would be like 300. So If i eat 4 muffins that are 40 cals that only adds up to 160. However eating 4 regular muffins would put you somewhere in the 1000s range in terms of calories. So i‚Äôm confused why I gained weight when they say the products are that low. They can‚Äôt lie on the label right? wouldn‚Äôt that be against the law or something? So if it‚Äôs true that my body is only absorbing 40 calories in those muffins then why would I have gained weight? ",1,2,1741734320.0,https://i.redd.it/88m32s3d65oe1.jpeg

I don't mean I don't eat many, I mean I don't eat *any*. I haven't eaten a vegetable other than canned green beans (and this is many years ago. 1 out of 100 days now my wife will include them with dinner and I'm always sure to eat some.) I have never eaten a raw vegetable and been able to swallow it. Same for even canned vegetables like peas, carrots, and corn. I'm sure you get it by now, but I wanted to make sure I emphasized that there were genuinely no exceptions.
My wife eats vegetables all the time, my daughter (she is my wife's daughter, I am her stepdad) even eats some. My son is 9 months old and of course just eats baby food.
I am worried my lack of vegetables and fruit will begin to harm my health. I am worried it will impact my ability to properly raise my son. 
My question is, what do I do? Do you all have any advice at all on how to learn to like them?
I should also note that I am not in bad health, I am not overweight at all, I have had kidney stones and a dislocated knee one time. But those are my only prominent health issues apart from esophageal ulcers.

1j8943k,diet,Retaking Control of My Diet!,"A little background first...

I'm 34, and from the time I was probably 17 to about 31 I worked out religiously, anywhere from 3-5, sometimes 6 days a week.  Admittedly, I threw caution to the wind the bulk of that time in my 20's just eating whatever.  But I had such a high metabolic rate, I not only kept the weight off, but was pretty tone as well.

It wasn't until I hit my late 20's I saw the impact my diet was having on me, even with routine exercise.  I pulled out all the stops about the time I was 29 and was eating protein rich, nutritious meals, and putting on a lot more muscle and feeling great!

Then, I got a new job.  This job paid very well, but involved copious amounts of travel.  I was on the road a lot, and enjoying the travel and seeing new places, but also was eating whatever I wanted.  I proceeded over the next few years to put on a good 20 lbs.  I'm not a big guy, maybe 5'10"" and 180lbs. which is ""technically"" overweight, but I also carry it pretty evenly.  But this is how it starts, 20 lbs. here, 30 there, then you balloon to 40-50 lbs. overweight.

I'm getting back to eating healthy, but I'm starting small.  The past few weeks I've been making more meals at home.  Even when I don't meal prep and have to pickup lunch, I'm more cognizant of what I'm getting to eat.  Today it was a Chick-Fil-A wrap and a fruit cup, no dressing for the wrap.  So small modifications to start so I can build back the routine of eating better.  I've also cut out all soda and sugary drinks 100%, and I'm limiting alcohol as well.

Next I intend to start hitting the gym again.  In just the few short years of absence in not exercising regularly, I'm already seeing what it's done to my health.  From the weight gain, lack of mobility, strength, and flexibility.  If I pull something even in the slightest, I'm down for the count for days...

I know it'll be months before I really see the results, but I just have to discipline myself to keep at it and understand that the benefits of taking these steps forward now, will have huge benefits long term.

1j7q6dj,diet,Carbs don't make sense as a primary energy source,"Fats have a much higher ATP yield per gram at 106 compared to carbs 32 and our fat energy reservoir is also much larger than our glycogen reservoir. Carbs just have faster energy production and work better in an anaerobic environment, primary/preferred energy source comes down to what metabolic state you're adapted too glycoloysis for carbs and beta oxidation + ketosis for fats. 

It doesn't make sense to have carbs as a primary energy source because only a small amount of our energy expenditure comes from high output anaerobic activity. Go see how long you can maintain a sprint or max effort lift and how many calories you can burn whilst doing so, I guarantee it will only be about 1 minute and 20 something calories for most of you whereas endurance activity (which fat is more efficient at) can be maintained for hours and expend thousands of calories.

On top of that being carb adapted would actually be worse for energy management because you end up expending more glycogen at lower intensities where it's less efficient instead of using primarily fat and sparing glycogen for high intensity anaerobic activity. This will lead to faster glycogen depletion and that will lead to faster fatigue when doing high intensity anaerobic activity. Plus being glycoloysis adapted inhibits fat metabolism and increases fat storage due to hormonal changes like decreased glucagon and increased insulin making fat which is your most efficient and abundant energy source harder to access and utilise and that also makes losing body fat harder too.

Here are some macronutrient ratios going by total calorie intake which I think would be more appropriate for body composition, performance, health and longevity.

For fat loss and endurance 

30% protein

10% carbs

60% fat

For anabolism and high anaerobic output

25% protein (1g/1lb of ideal bodyweight)

25% carbs

50% fat",1,4,1741579430.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/diet/comments/1j7q6dj/carbs_dont_make_sense_as_a_primary_energy_source/

1j5p6li,diet,is the KFC double down really that bad?,"After checking [this source](https://www.fatsecret.co.in/calories-nutrition/kfc/double-down/1-serving?frc=True), I noticed that **one KFC Double Down** packs around **600 calories**, **36g of fat**, **15g of carbs**, and a solid **54g of protein**. Honestly, compared to most fast food burgers and sandwiches, that‚Äôs actually **not bad at all**. The macros are surprisingly decent, especially if you're on a **high-protein, low-carb** diet like me.

The only real downside I see is the use of **seed oils and preservatives**, which are pretty unavoidable with most fast food. But beyond that, from a **calorie and macro standpoint**, it‚Äôs fairly reasonable.

For some context, I‚Äôve been following a **strict keto diet** for the past **two months**. I do **intermittent fasting** daily, usually eating just **one meal at dinner**. I focus on **high protein and fat**, keeping **carbs and sugar as low as possible**, and averaging around **1,500 net calories per day**. I know a lot of people say that's low, but I feel good and can manage it. I also work out regularly, burning roughly **500 calories a day** according to **MyFitnessPal**. On top of that, I do a **24-hour fast once a week** just to give my system a reset. Whether it‚Äôs super effective or not, I figure it can‚Äôt hurt. Over the past two months, I‚Äôve already lost around **10kg**, so the results are definitely showing.

**Just to clarify**, yesterday was actually my **first time ever trying the Double Down**, so I don‚Äôt want to give the impression that I‚Äôve been eating it regularly these past two months. I'm really just wondering if it‚Äôs something that would be **safe to occasionally include in my regular diet** going forward, considering the macros fit pretty well within my current eating plan.

Would love to hear your thoughts!

  
**Edit:** I did notice that the Double Down is pretty high in **sodium**, which isn‚Äôt ideal. However, I drink around **5 liters of water daily** and i try to include foods that are rich in **potassium** to help balance things out.

1j5h976,diet,Will I break my health if I keep eating this way,"tl;dr:
Is this diet okay? If it is not then what can I do to make it into something that wont make me sick? (Diet plan is mentioned in between the post with points)

-------------------------------------------------------

I was fat few years ago and had low energy to exercise, so I decided to fix my diet. 

I dropped all processed food and only started eating whole food with 24 hours intermittent fasting (One-meal-a-day, OMAD diet)

But I was anxious that I may get sick due to lack of nutrients, so I decided to make a easiest diet that provides me over 100% rda of all nutrients

It is as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------
1. 100% whole wheat bread, 400g
2. Normal cow milk, 500 ml
3. 4 medium size chicken eggs (roughly 150-200g)
4. 1kg of high vitamin C fruit:
A. On winter: 1kg Guava or Orange (Roughly 300-400% rda)
B. On summer: 1kg Papaya or 1kg Mangos (Papayas cross roughly 700% rda Vit C, mangos a bit lower)
C. Other Seasons: 1kg Pineapple or similar high vitamin C fruit

Weekly:
1. Boiled Spinach, or other boiled leafy greens (Roughly 700-1000% RDA of vitamin K1, gets absorbed by liver to get used throughout week)
2. Boiled fish, roughly 500g
-------------------------------------------------------

1. No processed food, no tea, absolutely nothing. ONLY THIS diet and food mentioned in here. Maybe some new fruits now and then, but that's it

2. This diet is really easy, I dont have to cook anything, I just set 10 mins timer for boiling eggs and that's it.

.....Except the weekly ones. I have to clean spinach. Fish is inheritently difficult to eat as it has spikey bones I must dodge haha

3. Thanks to those extra work, I occasionally forget spinach and fish, and then my bones start hurting and so it reminds me that i must eat them haha

4. I dont have a fridge, so i have to eat bought fruits completely. And its difficult to buy small quantities often

5. It took me months to come up with this diet and surprisingly i found it exceed 100% rda of every single vitamin and mineral, except Zinc and Sulphur i think, they are struck to 60-80% rda

6. I went from 110kgs to 60kgs by following this eating habit (OMAD) and meal plan....

....And so, It is difficult to maintain weight with this diet.... sometimes I end up dropping below 60 kgs and body gets weak. Milk start tasting really sweet. So I add high carb food (like oats) and my weights increases again, and then I restart the same diet.

-------------------------------------------------------

My concerns and questions:

1. Mom and dad keep pressing me to eat normally or else I might break my health this way. Is it true??? My ""research"" on google tells me that I'll be fine (maybe), but I still ends up worrying

2. I end up eating the entire fruit and it crosses the vitamin C rda excessivily. Does this have risk to cause kidney failure or something??? 

3. I eat 4 eggs everyday, there are way too many research on eggs and they are really conflicting, so I also end up doubting if this can cause issues in long run or not

4. I LACK vegetables, as I must clean them and cook them. And thus this also brings fear to my heart... will I break my health this way???

5. One real problem I end up facing with this, is that my verbal fluency and language pronouncation got worse. ""A research found out that calorie restriction leads to decreased gray matter in right cerebellum, which is responsible for motor controls like verbal fluency and others. The decrease in gray matter isnt reverted after restarting the normal diet, and thus it is persistent"". To cope up with this I added walnuts with my diet.

-------------------------------------------------------

I have utensil and so I can cook. But it gets tendious so I always end up not cooking anything. I dont care about taste so I'm okay even with boiled vegetables with salt haha. 

So, if anybody can find faults in my diets and recommend me stuffs.... I'll be really happy! Thanks for reading!
